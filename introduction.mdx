title: Introduction
description: 'Arroyo Stream Processing Engine'
---

[Arroyo](https://arroyo.dev) is a distributed stream processing engine written in Rust, designed to efficiently
perform stateful computations on streams of data. Unlike traditional batch processors, streaming engines can operate
on both bounded and unbounded sources, emitting results as soon as they are available.

In short: Arroyo lets you ask complex questions of high-volume real-time data with sub-second results.

Arroyo can be self-hosted, or used via the [Arroyo Cloud](https://arroyo.dev/) service managed by Arroyo Systems.

## Features

- Pipelines defined in SQL, with support for complex analytical queries
- Scales up to millions of events per second
- Stateful operations like windows and joins
- State checkpointing for fault-tolerance and pipeline recovery
- Event time processing with watermark support

## Use cases

Some example use cases include:

- Detecting fraud and security incidents
- Real-time product and business analytics
- Real-time ingestion into your data warehouse or data lake
- Real-time ML feature generation

## Why Arroyo

There are already a number of existing streaming engines out there, including [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org),
[Spark Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html), and
[Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/). Why create a new one?

- **Serverless operations**: Arroyo pipelines are designed to run in modern cloud environments, supporting seamless scaling,
  recovery, and rescheduling
- **High performance SQL**: SQL is a first-class concern, with consistently excellent performance
- **Designed for everyone**: Arroyo cleanly separates the pipeline APIs from its internal implementation. You don't
  need to be a streaming expert to build real-time data pipelines.

## Getting Started

Arroyo ships as a single binary, which can be easily installed locally or run in a container.

<CodeGroup>
```shellsession MacOS
brew install arroyosystems/tap/arroyo
```

```shellsession Linux
curl -LsSf https://arroyo.dev/install.sh | sh
```

```shellsession Docker
docker run -p 5115:5115 \
      ghcr.io/arroyosystems/arroyo:latest
```

```shellsession Kubernetes
helm repo add arroyo https://helm.arroyo.dev
helm install arroyo arroyo/arroyo
```

</CodeGroup>

 See the
[getting started guide](/getting-started) to get up and running with a local Arroyo deployment.


### In production

Arroyo supports several deployment targets for production use, including native support for Kubernetes. See the
[deployment docs](/deployment/overview) for more information.

## License

Arroyo is fully open-source under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/tree/master/LICENSE-apache).

## Support

### Commerical support

Commercial support is offered by [Arroyo Systems](https://www.arroyo.dev), the creators of Arroyo. Reach out to
[support@arroyo.systems](mailto:support@arroyo.systems) to get in touch.

### Community support

Community support is offered via the [Arroyo Discord](https://discord.gg/cjCr5rVmyR) where the Arroyo development
team and community are actively engaged in helping users get started and solve their probelms with Arroyo.

## Telemetry

By default, Arroyo collects limited and anonymous usage data to help us
understand how the system is being used and to help prioritize future
development.

You can opt out of telemetry by setting `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true` when running
Arroyo services.
