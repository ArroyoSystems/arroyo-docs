## Dependencies

To build Arroyo, you will need to install some dependencies.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Ubuntu">

Follow these command to get the necessary dependencies to build Arroyo on Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install pkg-config build-essential \
  libssl-dev openssl cmake curl postgresql postgresql-client
$ sudo systemctl start postgresql
$ wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v21.8/protoc-21.8-linux-x86_64.zip
$ unzip protoc-21.8-linux-x86_64.zip
$ sudo mv bin/protoc /usr/local/bin
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
$ cargo install refinery_cli
$ curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="MacOS">

First, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if it's not already installed. Then,
run the following commands:

```bash
$ brew install postgresql
$ brew install protobuf
$ brew install pnpm
$ brew install cmake
```

Next install Rust:

```bash
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
```

Finally, install the following packages:

```bash
$ cargo install refinery_cli
$ cargo install cargo-nextest
```

## Get the source

The Arroyo source can be checked out from GitHub with:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo.git
```

## Postgres

Developing Arroyo requires running a properly configured postgres instance. By default,
it expects a database called `arroyo`, a user `arroyo` with password `arroyo`, although that
can be changed by setting the following environment variables:

* `DATABASE_NAME`
* `DATABASE_HOST`
* `DATABASE_PORT`
* `DATABASE_USER`
* `DATABASE_PASSWORD`

On Ubuntu, you can set up a compatible database like this:

```bash
$ sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER arroyo WITH PASSWORD 'arroyo' SUPERUSER;"
$ sudo -u postgres createdb arroyo
```

On MacOS:

```bash
$ psql postgres -c "CREATE USER arroyo WITH PASSWORD 'arroyo' SUPERUSER;"
$ createdb arroyo
```


Migrations are managed using [refinery](https://github.com/rust-db/refinery). Once Postgres is
set up, you can initialize it with

```bash
$ refinery setup # follow the prompts
$ mv refinery.toml ~/
$ refinery migrate -c ~/refinery.toml -p crates/arroyo-api/migrations
```

We use [cornucopia](https://github.com/cornucopia-rs/cornucopia) for typed-checked SQL queries. Our build is set up
to automatically re-generate the rust code for those queries on build, so you will need a DB set up for compilation
as well.

## Building the frontend

We use pnpm and vite for frontend development. Once pnpm is installed (following the OS-specific) instructions
above, you should be able to build the console like this:

```
$ cd webui
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm build
```

This must be done before running the services, as the API service will expect to find the compiled webui source
so it can serve it.

## Building the services

Arroyo is built via Cargo, the Rust build tool. All services are built into a single binary, arroyo, which
can be built with

```
$ cargo build --package arroyo
```

<Tip>
By default, Cargo builds in _debug mode_ which gives you shorter build times in exchange for slower execution
speeds. This is great for development, but you should make sure to always build in release mode (`cargo build --release`)
before deploying or benchmarking.
</Tip>

This will build the binary in target/debug/arroyo. Running that you should see the available subcommands:

```
$ target/debug/arroyo
Usage: arroyo <COMMAND>

Commands:
  api         Starts an Arroyo API server
  controller  Starts an Arroyo Controller
  cluster     Starts a complete Arroyo cluster
  worker      Starts an Arroyo worker
  compiler    Starts an Arroyo compiler
  node        Starts an Arroyo node server
  migrate     Runs database migrations on the configure Postgres database
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

### Running a cluster

All of the services can be run together in a single cluster, or individually. For development,
it's most typical to run them together using the `cluster` subcommand:

```
$ target/debug/arroyo cluster
```

This will start a new Arroyo cluster with the default "process" scheduler, which runs each pipeline
as a separate process on the same node.

You can then open http://localhost:8000 to use your new cluster.

Cargo also allows combining the build-run process into a single step, with the `cargo run` command, for example:

```
$ cargo run --bin arroyo -- cluster
```

<Tip>
  On MacOS, you may see this error in the controller logs when trying to run a job:

  ```
  Child ("/tmp/arroyo-process/m2lgldjw") exited with status Ok(ExitStatus(unix_wait_status(9)))
  ```

  This means that MacOS gatekeeper is killing the pipeline binary. To allow the pipeline to run,
  open System Settings and navigate to Privacy & Security -> Developer Tools. In the list, add and
  enable your terminal (for example Terminal.app or iTerm).
</Tip>

## Front-end development

When developing the frontend, you can take advantage of vite's dev server to shorten the dev cycle:

```
$ cd webui
$ pnpm run dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:5173/. This requires the cluster is running on http://localhost:8000.

### Updating frontend definitions

After altering protobuf definitions in `arroyo-rpc` you need to regenerate the Typescript code used by the frontend:

```bash
$ pnpm run generate
```

Similarly, after altering REST API types in `arroyo-api` you need to run:

```bash
$ pnpm run openapi
```

## Testing

Arroyo includes a large suite of tests covering most parts of the system. We use the standard Rust test framework,
which can be invoked via

```
$ cargo test
```

We also recommend [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/), which provides a better UX on top of the standard test runner.

```
$ cargo nextest run
```

See the nextest docs for all options.

Connector tests may require a running local instance of that system to pass; for example the full test suite currently
requires kafka and an mqtt broker.

## Building docker

The Arroyo repo includes a
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile)
to package Arroyo for development and deployment via Kubernetes or Docker
Compose.

For efficiency, we use _targets_ to build images for different purposes. The available targets are

* `arroyo` -- includes only the Arroyo binary; most useful for deploying on Kubernetes or in Docker Compose
* `arroyo-full` -- also includes a Rust compile environment; this is needed for building UDFs within the Web UI; the
  compiler service will dynamically fetch the necessary dependencies, but you may choose to use arroyo-full if you're
  running in an environment that does not allow external internet access

To build a particular target, run

```
$ docker build . -f docker/Dockerfile -t {target} --target {target}
```

for example,

```
$ docker build . -f docker/Dockerfile -t arroyo-full --target arroyo-full
```

Note that this requires a fairly recent version of Docker that supports buildx.
