The core of Arroyo is a distributed dataflow engine.

## Distributed dataflow

The dataflow can be described as a directed acylic graph (DAG). Each node performs some (possibly stateful) computation,
while data flows between them along the edges. Because this is a distributed dataflow, each node in the graph can be
horizontally subdivided into multiple parallel subtasks. Each subtask is responsible for a subset of the key space.

There are two types of edges between nodes:

- _forward edges_ pass data to a single downstream subtask
- _shuffle edges_ pass data to all downstream subtasks

For example, we can look at a logical dataflow for a basic job that looks like this:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/dataflow.svg"
    alt="example of a logical dataflow"
    style={{ height: "300px", textAlign: "center" }}
  />
</Frame>

Because the join is keyed, we need to shuffle the data from the source tasks so that events with the same key are
processed by the same join subtask. Meanwhile, the sink doesn't require any particular key structure, so we can use a
forward edge.

This logical dataflow may be executed as a physical dataflow that looks like this:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/physical_plan.svg"
    alt="example of a physical dataflow"
    style={{ height: '400px', textAlign: 'center' }}
  />
</Frame>

where `source [0]` and `source [1]` represents two subtasks of the source task (and similarly for the join).

Each subtask may be scheduled independently. If two communicating subtasks are scheduled on the same worker, the
dataflow is performed via in-memory queues; otherwise the dataflow is performed via Arroyo's network stack which forms
a logical MxN connection between every communicating subtask.

## Streaming SQL

Arroyo pipelines are written using analytical SQL with a few extensions to support streaming semantics. See
our [What is streaming SQL?](https://www.arroyo.dev/blog/what-is-streaming-sql) blog post for a deep dive into
the semantics of streaming SQL, and the [SQL docs](/sql) for a detailed description of the language.

Arroyo's SQL support is built on top of the [Arrow DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) project,
which is responsible for parsing and planning SQL before we compile it into a streaming dataflow for execution.

## Time-oriented processing

Arroyo supports time-oriented processing, inspired by the model described in the
[Google Dataflow paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43864.html). A brief
overview of the model will be covered here, but a more in depth explanation can
be found in
[this article](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101/).

### Event time

Each event in the dataflow is assigned a timestamp. For sources that have a built-in notion of time (like
the record timestamp in Kafka) we default to that; for other sources we use the current wall-clock time
at ingestion. However it's often more useful to set the event time from a field in the data, which represents
some logical time, which can be done via a SQL expression in the CREATE TABLE statement for the source.

All time-oriented operations in the system are performed using this _event time_, rather than the time at which the data
is processed (called _processing time_). This allows the system to perform operations such as windowing consistently
no matter when or what order events arrive. In other words, for the same sequence of input events you should always get
the same output.

### Watermarks

Stream processing operates over unbounded streams of data. This means that the data is never complete. And in real world
systems, events may be arrive in any order and may be arbitrary delayed. But we still need to be able to compute results,
and can't wait indefinitely to be sure that all of the data has arrived.

To solve this problem, Arroyo uses _watermarks_ to track the progress of the dataflow. A watermark is an estimate of
completeness of the data stream; it represents a claim that no more events with a timestamp earlier than the watermark
will arrive in the future.

Watermarks are produced by the source based on its understanding of the characteristics of the data. Currently this is
a fixed offset from the last event timestamp, but in the future we will support more sophisticated watermarking approaches
that provide a statistical estimate of completeness. Once produced by the source, watermarks are propagated through the
dataflow, and are used to determine when to perform operations such as closing windows.

Late events (which arrive after the watermark has passed) are dropped.

## Stateful processing

Arroyo is a _stateful_ dataflow system. Each node in the dataflow graph can maintain state, which is required to perform
operations like joins and windowing. In the open-source release of Arroyo, state is stored in memory on the worker nodes,
which means that it is limited to the size of the worker's memory.

Arroyo regularly checkpoints state to ensure that it can recover from failures, and to allow for operations like scaling
and code updates. Checkpoints are consistent snapshots of the state of the dataflow at a particular point in time. In
other words, for every operator, an event _E_ is either in or not in the checkpoint. As the latest Kafka offset is also
stored in the checkpoint, that means that after we restore from the checkpoint, we can continue processing exactly where
we left off and get identical results as if we had never failed.

The algorithm for consistent checkpointing is based on the
[asynchronous barrier snapshot](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08603) algorithm, which itself is an extension of the
classic [Chandy-Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandy-Lamport_algorithm) algorithm.

Checkpoints are written to remote storage like S3 so that we can recover from
machine failures, and are stored in Parquet format.
