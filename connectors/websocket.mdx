[WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) is an API
that enables streaming communication between clients and servers. It is a common choice
for real-time web applications. Arroyo provides a WebSocket source that allows you to
read from WebSocket APIs in your pipeline.

WebSocket is a very flexible protocol, and does not have standard semantics for tracking
progress or restarting from a past point in time. As a result, the WebSocket source
may currently miss messages on recovery.

Various APIs may also require some level of negotiation before the WebSocket connection
becomes active. The WebSocket source currently supports sending a single subscription
message on connection, which is sufficient to work with many real-world APIs.

If you'd like to use the WebSocket source with an API that requires additional features,
reach out to the team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/cjCr5rVmyR).

## Configuring the Connection

Websocket sources can be created via the Web UI or directly in SQL.

A WebSocket source has several required and optional fields:

| Field | Description | Required | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| endpoint | The endpoint for the WebSocket server | Yes | `wss://api.example.com/v1/events` |
| subscription_message | A message that will be sent to the server after connection | No | ```{"type": "subscribe", "channel": "events"}``` |

For example, in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE coinbase (
    type TEXT,
    price TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'websocket',
    endpoint = 'wss://ws-feed.exchange.coinbase.com',
    subscription_message = '{
      "type": "subscribe",
      "product_ids": [
        "BTC-USD"
      ],
      "channels": ["ticker"]
    }',
    format = 'json'
);
```
