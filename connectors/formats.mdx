description: How to configure the format for sources and sinks
---

Arroyo supports a number of different data formats for connections, which
control how data is serialized and deserialized. For some connectors, the format
is fixed, while for others it can be configured.

The format is specified using the `format` option in SQL.

## Json

JSON is a common format for data interchange. Arroyo supports two flavors of JSON:

* `json` - JSON data in any format
* `debezium_json` - JSON data in the format produced by
  [Debezium](https://debezium.io/) for reading and writing from relational databases like Postgres

The following options are supported for both formats:

| Option | Description | Default |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `format` | The format of the data. May be one of `json` or `debezium_json` | `json` |
| `json.confluent_schema_registry` | Set to true if data was produced by (or will be consumed via) a [Confluent Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html) connected source | `false` |
| `json.include_schema` | Set to true to include the schema in the output, allowing it to be used with Kafka Connect connectors that require a schema | `false` |
| `json.unstructured` | Set to true to treat the data as unstructured JSON, which will be parsed as a single column of type `TEXT` | `false` |
| `json.timestamp_format` | The format of timestamps in the data. May be one of `rfc3339` or `unix_millis` | `rfc3339` |

Json data can be either structured or unstructured. Structured data is parsed
into columns according to the schema. Schemas can be specified via the fields in
a SQL CREATE TABLE statement (as described in the [DDL docs](/sql/ddl)) or
imported via a [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/) definition.

Note that json-schema is a very flexible format, and not all of its features can
be cleanly mapped to a SQL table. As a fallback, any fields that cannot be
directly supported by Arroyo will be rendered as a single column of type `TEXT`
with JSON-serialized data in it.

Unstructured data is treated as a single column named `value` with type `TEXT`, which can be operated on using
[SQL json functions](/sql/scalar-functions#json-functions) or UDFs.

## Avro

[Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) is a binary data format that is commonly used for
data applications. Avro is a schema-based format, and requires readers and writers to
have access to the schema in order to read and write data.

Avro is well-supported by the Kafka ecosystem where the
[Confluent Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html),
is a popular choice for storing and serving Avro schemas. Aroryo is able to read and write
Avro schemas from the Schema Registry.

The following options are supported:

| Option | Description | Default |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `format` | The format of the data. Must be `avro` | `avro` |
| `avro.confluent_schema_registry` | Set to true if data was produced by (or will be consumed via) a [Confluent Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html) connected source | `false` |
| `avro.raw_datums` | Set to true to serialize and deserialize as raw Avro datums instead of complete Avro records | `false` |
| `avro.into_unstructured_json` | Convert the avro record to JSON | `false` |

Avro data can be serialized/deserialized in two ways:

* As a raw Avro datum, which is just the data itself
* As a complete Avro document, which includes the schema and metadata

In the former mode, applications reading from the data will need to have access to the exact schema
used to write the data. This is the mode used for Confluent Schema Registry, as that provides a mechanism
to distribute the schema to readers.

In the latter mode, the schema will be embedded in every record, allowing any application to read it
without additional context. However, this is fairly inefficient as the schema will be repeated for every
record.

The `avro.into_unstructured_json` option, if set, will cause the Avro data to be deserialized and re-serialized
to JSON, which can then be operated on using [SQL json functions](/sql/scalar-functions#json-functions) or [UDFs](/sql/udfs).
This can be useful if the Avro schema for the data may change, and offers flexibility in how the data is
processed.

### Schema Registry Integration

For Kafka sources configured via the Web UI, Arroyo is able to automatically fetch the schema from the Schema Registry
and use it to determine the schema for the table.

When using Avro with a Kafka sink, Arroyo will automatically register the schema with the Schema Registry so
long as the `avro.confluent_schema_registry` option is set to `true`. This allows the schema to be used by
other applications that read from the same topic.

## Raw string

Raw string data is treated as a single column named `value` with type `TEXT`,
and can be operated on using
[SQL string functions](/sql/scalar-functions#string-functions) or [UDFs](/sql/udfs).

Raw string is supported for both deserialization (from sources) and serialization
(to sinks). As a serialization format, it can be useful for generating data in formats
that Arroyo does not support natively, for example via UDFs:

```rust
fn my_to_json(f: f64) -> String {
    let v = serde_json::json!({
        "my_complex": {
            "nested_format": f
        }
    });

    serde_json::to_string(&v).unwrap()
}
```

## Parquet

[Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) is a columnar data format that is commonly
used for storing data in data lakes. Arroyo supports writing Parquet via the FileSystem
sink. Refer for the [FileSystem sink docs](/connectors/filesystem) for details.
