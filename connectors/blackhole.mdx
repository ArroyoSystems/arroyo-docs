title: Blackhole Sink
description: "No-op sink that swallows all data"
---

The Blackhole sink is a no-op sink that swallows all data. It is most useful
for testing and benchmarking purposes, where the overhead of a real sink is
undeseriable.

## Configuring the Connection

Blackhole sinks can be created via the Web UI or directly in SQL.

Blackhole connections have no options.

For example, in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE blackhole (
    id TEXT,
    count BIGINT
)
WITH (
    connector = 'blackhole'
);
```
