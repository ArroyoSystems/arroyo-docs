title: Blackhole Sink
description: "No-op sink that swallows all data"
---

The Blackhole sink is a no-op sink that swallows all data. It is most useful
for testing and benchmarking purposes, where the overhead of a real sink is
undesirable.

## Configuring the Connection

Blackhole sinks can be created via the Web UI or directly in SQL.

Blackhole connections have no options.

As blackhole connections throw away the data, you can generally rely on
[schema inference](/sql/ddl#schema-inference) when creating the table.

For example, in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE blackhole
WITH (
    connector = 'blackhole'
);
```
