description: Connect Arroyo to external systems
---

Arroyo interacts with other data systems via _connectors_, which can implement sources and sinks for reading and writing
data respectively. The list of connectors is constantly expanding. If you'd like to connect Arroyo with a system that's
not currently supported, please get in touch with the team on Discord or via GitHub issues.

## Using connectors

Arroyo SQL supports a special kind of table called a _connection table_ which is
used to interact with external systems as sources or sinks.

Connection tables come in two forms. _Saved connections_ are created in the Web UI
or via the API and can be easily reused across queries. Existing saved connections
can be viewed via the Connections tab of the Web UI, and their schemas can be seen
in the catalogue view in the SQL editor.

Connection tables can also be created via `CREATE TABLE` statements in SQL, as described
in the [DDL](/sql/ddl) docs.

A particular connection table is either a _source_ (meaning it reads data from
an external system) or a _sink_ (meaning it writes data). Some connectors support
only one of these, while others support both.

See the individual connector docs for details on on their capabilities and how
to configure them in Arroyo.

## Connection profiles

For some connectors, Arroyo supports _connection profiles_,
which allow you to define common connection details once and use it across multiple connections.
Currently the [Kafka](/connectors/kafka),
[Redis](/connectors/redis), [Kinesis](/connectors/kinesis), and [MQTT](/connectors/mqtt) connectors support connection profiles.
Connection profiles are created as part of defining a saved connection in the Web UI,
where they can be reused.

In SQL, you can directly specify a connection profile via the `connection_profile` option in the `WITH` clause.
Alternately, SQL users can manually specify the various options via the WITH clause.

## Connection formats

Arroyo supports a number of different data formats for reading and writing data, including
JSON, Avro, Parquet, and raw strings. The format is configured via the `format` option
when creating a SQL table.

See the [format docs](/connectors/formats) for more details on how to configure each format.

## Framing

The framing configuration for a source determines how messages read from the
source are split into records for processing. This is particularly useful for
sources—like HTTP endpoints—that do not have their own framing protocol.

By default, the framing is `none`, which means that the source will emit a
single record for each message it reads.

Framing is configured via the `framing` option when creating a SQL table. Currently
only `newline` is supported, which splits the input on newlines.

You may also set `framing.newline.max_length` to a number of bytes to limit the
maximum length of a single record. Records that exceed this length will be truncated.

For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_source (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    ...
    framing = 'newline',
    'framing.newline.max_length' = '10000'
)
```

## Bad Data

The `bad_data` option allows you to configure how Arroyo handles records that fail
to parse.

- `fail`: fail the job (default)
- `drop`: drop the record and continue processing

You can configure it in the Web UI when creating a connection:

<img src="/images/bad_data.png" alt="Bad data dropdown" />

Or in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_source (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    ...
    bad_data = 'drop'
)
```

## Connection schemas

Connections in Arroyo must have associated schemas to allow them to be used in
SQL queries. Schemas describe how to interpret the data, mapping it into a table
composed of [Arroyo SQL types](/sql/data-types).

Schemas can be defined when creating the source in the Web UI or API, which
allows them to be reused across queries. Arroyo supports several methods of
schema definition, some of which are also associated with a particular data
format:

* [Json Schema](https://json-schema.org/)
* [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html)
* [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) (in progress)

Json and Avro Schemas for Kafka topics can also be read automatically from
[Confluent Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html).


## Source idleness

Partitioned sources (like Kafka or Kinesis) may experience periods when some
partitions are active but others are idle due to the way that they are keyed.
This can cause issues in Arroyo due to how [watermarks](/concepts/#watermarks) are
calculated: as the minimum of the watermarks of all partitions.

If some partitions are idle, the watermark will not advance, and queries that
depend on it will not make progress. To address this, sources support a concept
of _idleness_, which allows them to mark partitions as idle after a period of
inactivity. Idle partitions, meanwhile, are ignored for the purpose of calculating
watermarks and so allow queries to advance.

Idleness is enabled by default for all sources with a period of 5 minutes. It can be
configured when creating a source in SQL by setting the `idle_micros` options, or disabled
by setting it to `-1`.

A special case of idleness occurs when there are more Arroyo source tasks than partitions
(for example, a Kafka topic with 4 partitions read by 8 Arroyo tasks). This means that
some tasks will never receive data, and so will never advance their watermarks. This can
occur as well for non-partitioned sources like WebSocket, where only a single task is
able to read data.

To address this, source tasks with no work assigned to them will mark themselves as idle
immediately.

## Environment variable substitution

Some fields in the connection configurations can use environment variables to substitute values
at runtime. This is useful for secrets or other values that you don't want to hard-code.
Currently, environment variable substitution is supported for fields containing API keys,
usernames, passwords, and HTTP headers.

You can use double curly braces (`{{ }}`) to indicate a substitution.

For example, in the Web UI:

<img src="/images/env_var.png" alt="Environment variable subtitution" />

Or directly in SQL like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE data (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'polling_http',
    endpoint = 'https://mywebserver.com/api/data',
    method = 'GET',
    headers = 'Authorization: bearer {{ MY_TOKEN }}',
    format = 'json'
);
```
