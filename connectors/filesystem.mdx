Arroyo provides the capability to write Parquet and JSON files to S3 and local filesystems.
This will produce complete files in line with the checkpointing system.
As such, the file system sinks write all data exactly once.

## Configuring the File System Sink

The file system sink is currently only configurable through SQL,
 using the [SQL DDL](sql/ddl) syntax.
 The connector name will be `filesystem` and there are several additional options
 
 ### Destination Options

 | Field | Description | Required | Example |
 | ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
 | `path` | A URI to the target destination | No | `file:///test-data/my-cool-arroyo-pipeline`, `https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/awesome-arroyo-bucket/amazing-arroyo-dir` |
 | `s3_bucket` | The S3 bucket to write to | No | `awesome-arroyo-bucket` |
 | `S3_directory` | The S3 directory to write to | No | `amazing-arroyo-dir` |
 | `aws_region`| The AWS region to write to | No | `us-west-2` |

### Output File Options
| Field | Description | Default | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| `target_file_size` | Target number of bytes in a file before it is closed and a new file is opened | `None` | `100000000` |
| `target_part_size` | The target size in bytes of each part of a multipart upload. Must be at least 5MB. | `5242880` | `10000000`|
| `max_parts` | Maximum number of multipart uploads | `1000` | `50` |
| `rollover_seconds` | Number of seconds a file will be open before it is closed and a new file is opened | `30` | `3600` |
| `inactivity_rollover_seconds` | Number of seconds a file will be open without any new data before it is closed and a new file is opened | `None` | `600` |
| `format` | The format to write the data in. Supported values: `parquet`, `json` | Required | `json` |

### Parquet Options
Parquet has a few supported options. Please reach out if you'd like to expand the settings allowed.

| Field | Description | Default | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| `parquet_compression` | The compression codec to use for Parquet files. Supported values: `none`, `snappy`, `gzip`, `zstd`, `lz4`. | `none` | `zstd` |
| `parquet_row_batch_size` | The maximum number of rows to write per record batch | `10000` | `100`|
| `parquet_row_group_size` | The maximum number of rows to write per row group | `1000000` | `100000` |


## File System Sink DDL

Here's an example for how to create a table to write parquet to S3:
```sql
CREATE TABLE bids (
  auction bigint,
  bidder bigint,
  price bigint,
  datetime timestamp
) WITH (
  connector ='filesystem',
  path = 'https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo/s3-uri',
  format = 'parquet',
  parquet_compression = 'zstd',
  rollover_seconds = '60'
);
