title: Impulse
description: "Periodic generator source"

The Impulse source generates a stream of events at a specified interval. It is useful for
testing and can be used to drive more complex generated sources.

## Configuring the Connection

Impulse sources can be created via the Web UI or directly in SQL.

An impulse connection has several required and optional fields:

| Field | Description | Required | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| event_rate | The number of messages per second to produce | Yes | 100 |
| event_time_interval | The number of microseconds between the event times of subsequent events emitted by the source; if not set wall-clock time is used | No | 200000 |
| message_count | If set, the source will finish after emitting this many messages; otherwise it runs indefinitely | No | 50000 |

An impulse source can be created in SQL like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE impulse WITH (
    connector = 'impulse',
    event_rate = '100'
);
```
