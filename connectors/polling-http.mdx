title: Polling HTTP
description: "Read from streaming HTTP sources"
---

The Polling HTTP source periodically polls an HTTP endpoint and emits the
response as a record. This can be used to turn any HTTP API into a streaming
data source.

## Configuring the Connection

Polling HTTP sources can be created via the Web UI or directly in SQL.

An polling http connection has several required and optional fields:

| Field | Description | Required | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| endpoint | The endpoint for the HTTP server | Yes | `https://api.example.com/v1/events` |
| headers | A comma-separated list of colon separated key-value pairs of headers that will be sent to the server | No | ```Content-Type:application/json,Authorization: Bearer mytoken```
| method | The HTTP method to use when polling the endpoint | No | `GET` |
| body | The body to send with the request | No | `{"foo": "bar"}` |
| poll_interval_ms | The interval at which to poll the endpoint, in milliseconds | No | `5000` |
| emit_behavior | Controls when records are emitted; can be `all` or `changed` | No | `changed` |


For example, in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE prs (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'polling_http',
    endpoint = 'https://api.github.com/repos/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pulls?per_page=1&state=all',
    poll_interval_ms = '5000',
    emit_behavior = 'changed',
    headers = 'User-Agent:arroyo/0.6',
    format = 'json',
    'json.unstructured' = 'true'
);
```
