RabbitMQ is a message broker that supports a wide variety of event-processing
patterns and protocols. The Arroyo RabbitMQ connector supports reading from its
native its native [Streams protocol](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/streams),
which has capabilities around replay and persistence to support at-least-once
semantics for processing.

(To use RabbitMQ's MQTT support, see the [MQTT](/connectors/mqtt) connector.)

## Configuring the source

RabbitMQ Stream connections can be created via the Web UI or using SQL DDL.

A RabbitMQ Stream source requires the following fields:

| Field | Description                | Required      | Example |
| ----- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| host | RabbitMQ host address       | Yes           | localhost |
| port | RabbitMQ port               | No            | 5552 |
| username | RabbitMQ username         | No            | guest |
| password | RabbitMQ password         | No            | guest |
| virtual_host | RabbitMQ virtual host    | No            | / |
| tls_config.enabled | Enable TLS for the connection | No | true |
| tls_config.trust_certificates | Trust all certificates | No | true |
| tls_config.root_certificates_path | Path to root certificates | No | /path/to/certs |
| tls_config.client_certificates_path | Path to client certificates | No | /path/to/client/certs |
| tls_config.client_keys_path | Path to client keys | No | /path/to/keys |
| load_balancer_mode | Enable load balancer mode for the connection | No | true |
| stream | The RabbitMQ stream to read from | Yes | my-stream |
| type | Must be 'source' | Yes | source |
| source.offset | Starting offset for the source. One of 'first', 'next', or 'last' | No | last |

See the [RabbitMQ Streams documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/streams.html) for more details on these configurations.

## Connection Profiles

Arroyo connectors split their configuration into two parts: the _profile_
configuration for common connection details (like authentication and server
settings), and the _table_ configuration for specifics of the data being
consumed.

For RabbitMQ Streams, the profile represents the RabbitMQ server configuration,
while the table represents a particular stream and its offset. Profiles can be
shared across multiple tables and defined via the Web UI or SQL DDL using the
`connection_profile` option.

## Examples

### RabbitMQ Stream Source

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
) WITH (
    type = 'source',
    connector = 'rabbitmq',
    host = 'localhost',
    stream = 'my-stream',
    username = '{{ RABBITMQ_USER }}',
    password = '{{ RABBITMQ_PASSWORD }}',
    format = 'json',
    source.offset = 'last'
);
```
