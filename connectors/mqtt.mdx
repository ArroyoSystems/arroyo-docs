[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) is a lightweight queueing protocol commonly used in
the IoT industry. The Arroyo MQTT connector can use MQTT brokers as sources and
sinks using configurable reliability.

## Configuring the Connection

MQTT connections can be created with the Web UI or SQL DDL.

An MQTT connection has several required and optional fields:

| Field | Description                | Required      | Example |
| ----- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| url   | The URL of the MQTT broker | Yes            | tcp://localhost:1883 |
| username | Username for the MQTT broker | For password auth | bob     |
| password | Password for the MQTT broker | for password auth | hunter2 |
| tls.ca | Path to the CA file | For TLS auth | /mount/certs/ca.pem |
| tls.cert | Path to the client cert file auth | For TLS auth | /mount/certs/client.pem |
| tls.key| Path to the client key file | For TLS auth | /mount/certs/client.key |
| topic | The MQTT topic to read or write from | Yes | events |
| qos | One of 'AtMostOnce', 'AtleastOnce', or 'ExactlyOnce' | No | AtMostOnce |
| type | Either 'source' or 'sink'             | Yes | source |
| sink.retain | Whether to retain messages published to this topic | No | false |

## Connection Profiles

Arroyo connectors can split their configuration into two parts: the _profile_
config, which covers the common details of how to connect and authenticate
against a cluster, and the _table_ config which is specific to a particular
instance of the connector.

For MQTT, the profile represents a particular MQTT broker or cluster, while the
table represents a particular topic.

MQTT profiles can be defined via the Web UI and shared across multiple tables.
They can be used in SQL DDL by setting the `connection_profile` option in the `WITH`
clause.

See the [connection profile](/connectors/overview#connection-profiles) docs for more details.

## Source metadata

The MQTT connector supports accessing the following metadata fields:

* `topic TEXT` - the MQTT topic the message was consumed from

See the [source metadata](/connectors/overview#source-metadata) docs for more on how to use metadata fields.


## Examples

### MQTT Source

```sql
create table mqtt_source (
    id TEXT,
    lat FLOAT,
    lng FLOAT,
    type INT,
    topic TEXT METADATA FROM 'topic'
) with (
    connector = 'mqtt',
    url = 'tcp://localhost:1833',
    type = 'source',
    format = 'json',
    topic = 'events'
);
```

### MQTT Sink

```sql
create table mqtt_sink with (
    connector = 'mqtt',
    url = 'tcp://localhost:1833',
    type = 'sink',
    format = 'json',
    topic = 'results',
    'sink.retain' = true
);
```
