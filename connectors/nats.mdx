[NATS](https://nats.io) is a messaging and queueing system designed for
simplicity and performance. Arroyo includes sources and sinks for Core NATS and
NATS Jetstream, which layers on persistence and delivery guarantees.


## Configuring the Connection

NATS connections can be created with the Web UI or SQL DDL.

<img src="/images/nats.png" alt="Creating a NATS connection" />

An NATS connection has several required and optional fields:

| Field | Description                | Required      | Example |
| ----- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| servers | Comma-separated list of NATS servers | Yes            | nats-1:4222,nats-2:4222 |
| auth.type | One of 'none', 'credentials', or `jqt` | No | credentials |
| auth.username | Username for auth | For auth.type = 'credentials' | bob |
| auth.password | Password for auth | For auth.type = 'credentials' | hunter2 |
| auth.jwt | JWT token string used for JWT-based authentication with NATS | If `auth.type = 'jwt'` | `eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9...` |
| auth.nkey_seed | NKEY seed string (private key) used to sign authentication challenges when using JWT-based authentication | If `auth.type = 'jwt'` | `SUAFK5ZQJXPQ...` |
| type | Either 'source' or 'sink'             | Yes | source |
| stream | The NATS stream to read from, for jetstream | One of stream or subject | events-arroyo |
| subject | The Core NATS subject to read or write from | One of stream or subject | events |
| consumer.ack_policy | One of 'Explicit', 'None', or 'All' |  No | Explicit |
| consumer.replay_policy | One of 'Original' or 'Instant' | No | Instant |
| consumer.ack_wait | Duration in seconds that the server will wait for an ack for any individual message once it has been delivered to a consumer | No | 300 |
| consumer.description | Description of the consumer | No | arroyo-consumer |
| consumer.filter_subjects | Comma-separated list of subjects the consumer should filter on | No | events1,events2 |
| consumer.num_replicas | Number of replicas for the consumer's state | No | 3 |
| consumer.inactive_threshold | Duration in seconds before inactive consumers will be cleaned up | No | 600 |
| consumer.rate_limit | Maximum number of messages per second that will be delivered to consumer (-1 for no limit) | No | 1000 |
| consumer.max_ack_pending | Maximum number of messages without an acknowledgement that may be in flight before sending is paused (-1 for no limit) | No | 1000 |
| consumer.max_deliver | Maximum number of times a specific message delivery will be attempted (-1 for no limit) | No | 20 |
| consumer.max_waiting | Maximum number of messages that can be waiting to be delivered (-1 for no limit) | No | 10000 |
| consumer.max_batch | Maximum number of messages that may be delivered in a single batch | No | 1000 |
| consumer.max_bytes | Maximum number of bytes that will be delivered in a single batch | No | 104857600 |
| consumer.max_expires | Maximum number of messages that can be delivered to the consumer before they are considered expired | No | 30000 |

See the [NATS documentation](https://docs.nats.io/) for more explanation of these configurations.

## Connection Profiles

Arroyo connectors can split their configuration into two parts: the _profile_
config, which covers the common details of how to connect and authenticate
against a cluster, and the _table_ config which is specific to a particular
instance of the connector.

For NATS, the profile represents a particular NATS server or cluster, while the
table represents a particular subject or stream.

NATS profiles can be defined via the Web UI and shared across multiple tables.
They can be used in SQL DDL by setting the `connection_profile` option in the `WITH`
clause.

See the [connection profile](/connectors/overview#connection-profiles) docs for more details.

## Examples

### NATS Source

```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    host TEXT NOT NULL,
    level TEXT NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL
) with (
    type = 'source',
    connector = 'nats',
    servers = 'localhost:4222',
    subject = 'logs',
    'auth.type' = 'credentials',
    'auth.username' = '{{ NATS_USER }}',
    'auth.password' = '{{ NATS_PASSWORD }}',
    format = 'json'
);
```

### NATS Sink

```sql
CREATE TABLE results (
    count BIGINT NOT NULL,
    time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
) with (
    type = 'sink',
    connector = 'nats',
    servers = 'localhost:4222',
    subject = 'results',
    format = 'json'
);
```
