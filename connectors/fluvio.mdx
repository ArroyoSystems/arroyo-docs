description: "Use Fluvio topics as sources and sinks"

Arroyo provides sources and sinks for [Fluvio](https://fluvio.io/) for
consistently reading and writing data from Fluvio topics. Fluvio is a
distributed streaming platform built on top of Rust and Kubernetes. Fluvio has
support for simple, stateless processing, but with Arroyo it can be extended to
perform complex, stateful processing and analytics.

## Configuring the Connection

Fluvio connections can be created via the Web UI or in SQL.

A Fluvio connection has several required and optional fields:

| Field | Description | Required | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| endpoint | The endpoint of your Fluvio cluster; if not specified the default profile is used | No | `my-cluster:9003` |
| topic | The name of the Fluvio topic to read from or write to | Yes |
| type | The type of table (either 'source' or 'sink') | Yes | `source` |
| source.offset | The offset to start reading from (either 'earliest' or 'latest') | If source | `earliest` |

## Fluvio Sources

Fluvio sources can be created via the Web UI, the API, or directly in SQL. A
FLuvio source is defined by a topic name and a schema.

Schemas can be defined via json-schema or via SQL DDL statements.

Fluvio sources implement exactly-once semantics by storing the last-read offset
in Arroyo's state.

## Fluvio Sinks

Fluvio sinks can be created via the Web UI, the API, or directly in SQL. A
Fluvio sink is defined by a topic name and schema. Currently, Fluvio sinks only
support writing JSON data, with the structure determined by the schema of the
data being written.

## Fluvio DDL

Fluvio sources and sinks can be created directly in SQL. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE source (
  value TEXT
) WITH (
  connector = 'fluvio',
  format = 'raw_string',
  topic = 'greetings',
  type = 'source'
);


CREATE TABLE sink (
  msg TEXT
) WITH (
  connector = 'fluvio',
  format = 'json',
  topic = 'fluvio-sink',
  type = 'sink'
);
```
