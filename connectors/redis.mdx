Arroyo includes two types of Redis connectors: a sink and a lookup connector,
for lookup joins.

## Sink

The Redis sink allows you to write data to a [Redis](https://redis.io) instance
or cluster. Redis is a great choice for use cases where you need low-latency access
to the outputs of your Arroyo pipeline.

The Redis sink uses pipelining to achieve high throughput and is capable of
writing millions of records per second to a single Redis instance.

Redis supports a variety of data structures. Currently, the Redis sink supports
writing to the following data structures:
* [Strings](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/strings/)
* [Hashes](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/hashes)
* [Lists](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/lists)

Each value in Redis is identified by a key. The configuration of the Redis sink
allows you to construct the key in various ways, including a fixed prefix and
a suffix constructed from the columns of the result.

The value for each record will be the serialized representation of the row,
using the configured format.

### Configuring the Connection

Redis sinks can be created in the Web UI or directly in SQL.

### General configuration

| Field | Description | Required | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| address | The address of a single, non-clustered Redis instance | No* | `redis://localhost:6379` |
| cluster.addresses | A comma-separated list of addresses of Redis instances in a cluster | No* | `redis://localhost:6379,redis://localhost:6380` |
| type | The type of table (currently only `sink` is supported) | Yes | `sink` |
| target | The data type to write to. Currently, `string`, `hash`, and `list` are supported | Yes | `string` |
| target.key_prefix | A prefix that will be prepended to all keys | Yes | `outputs.` |
| target.key_columns | A column whose value will be appended to the key for each record | No | `id` |

#### `string` target

| Field | Description | Required | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| target.ttl_secs | The time-to-live for each key in seconds | No | `3600` |

#### `list` target

| Field | Description | Required | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| target.max_length | The max length for this list; once the list exceeds this, the oldest elements will be dropped | No | 100 |
| target.operation | The operation to perform on the list; one of 'append' (default) or 'prepend' | No | `append` |

#### `hash` target

| Field | Description | Required | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| target.field_column | This column will be used as the field name in the hash | Yes | `key` |

### Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE redis (
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  event_count BIGINT NOT NULL,
) WITH (
    connector = 'redis',
    type = 'sink',
    format = 'json',
    'address' = 'redis://localhost:6379',
    target = 'string',
    'target.key_prefix' = 'outputs.',
    'target.key_column' = 'user_id'
);

INSERT INTO redis
SELECT user_id, count(*)
FROM events
GROUP BY
    user_id, hop(interval '5 seconds', interval '1 hour');
```

Given the above query, we can see the following output in Redis:

```
$ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> GET outputs.fred
"{\"user_id\":\"fred\",\"event_count\":10}"
```

## Lookup

Redis can also be used as a source for [lookup joins](/sql/joins#lookup-joins). When used in
a lookup join, queries are made via a Redis `GET` command, supporting key-value records.

Lookup tables must currently be created via SQL. A Redis lookup table looks like this:

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE customers (
    -- For Redis lookup tables, it's required that there be a single
    -- METADATA FROM 'key' marked as PRIMARY KEY, as Redis only supports
    -- efficient lookups by key
    customer_id TEXT METADATA FROM 'key' PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    plan TEXT
) with (
    connector = 'redis',
    address = 'redis://localhost:6379',
    format = 'json',
    'lookup.cache.max_bytes' = 1000000,
    'lookup.cache.ttl' = interval '5 seconds'
);
```

The address and format arguments are required.
