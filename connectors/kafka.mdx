description: "Use Kafka topics as sources and sinks"
---

Arroyo provides sources and sinks for [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
for consistently reading and writing data from Kafka topics using exactly-once
semantics. Kafka's distributed log model makes it a great fit for stream
processing applications like Arroyo.

Arroyo supports Kafka clusters that are self-hosted, using Amazon
MSK<sup>1</sup>, and Confluent Cloud.

*<sup>1</sup> Note that MSK Serverless is not currently supported due to its
reliance on non-standard IAM authentication*

## Configuring the Connection

Kafka connections can be created via the Web UI or via SQL.

A Kafka connection has several required and optional fields:

| Field | Description | Required | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| bootstrap_servers | A comma-separated list of Kafka servers to connect to | Yes | `kafka-server-1.cluster:9092,kafka-server-2.cluster:9092` |
| auth.type | One of 'none' or 'sasl' | No | `sasl` |
| auth.protocol | The SASL protocol to use (e.g., `SASL_PLAINTEXT`, `SASL_SSL`) | No | `SASL_PLAINTEXT` |
| auth.mechanism | The SASL mechanism to use (e.g., `SCRAM-SHA-256`, `SCRAM-SHA-512`) | No | `SCRAM-SHA-256` |
| auth.username | The username to use for SASL authentication | No | `user` |
| auth.password | The password to use for SASL authentication | No | `password` |
| topic | The name of the Kafka topic to read from or write to | Yes |
| type | The type of table (either 'source' or 'sink') | Yes | `source` |
| source.offset | The offset to start reading from (either 'earliest' or 'latest') | No | `earliest` |
| source.read_mode | The read mode to use. 'read_committed' only reads committed Kafka messages, while 'read_uncommitted' will read all messages.  | No | `read_committed` |
| source.group_id | For sources, sets the Kafka consumer group to use; note that using the same group for multiple pipelines will result in each pipeline seeing only a subset of the data | No | `my-group` |
| sink.commit_mode | The commit mode to use (either 'exactly_once' or 'at_least_once') | No | `exactly_once` |
| schema_registry.endpoint | The URL of the Confluent Schema Registry to use | No | `https://schema-registry.cluster:8081` |
| schema_registry.api_key | The API Key to use for the Schema Registry. Will be the username via basic auth | No | `ABCDEFGHIJK01234` |
| schema_registry.api_secret | The API Secret to use for the Schema Registry. Will be the password via basic auth | No | `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789` |


## Kafka Sources

Kafka sources can be created via the Web UI, the API, or directly in SQL. A
Kafka source is defined by a topic name and a schema.

Schemas can be defined via json-schema, or automatically configured via
Confluent Schema Registry.

Kakfa sources implement exactly-once semantics by storing the last-read offset in Arroyo's state.
Additionally, you can set `source.read_mode` to `read_committed` to ensure that only committed messages are read.

## Kafka Sinks

Kafka sinks can be created via the Web UI, the API, or directly in SQL. A Kafka
sink is defined by a topic name. Currently, Kafka sinks only support writing
JSON data, with the structure determined by the schema of the data being
written.

The Kafka sink supports both *exactly once* and *at least once* modes.
At least once delivery will proactively write to the downstream Kafka topic
as messages come in. This can potentially result in duplicate messages in the event of a pipeline failure.

Exactly once delivery writes to Kafka using its transaction API.
Data is staged within each epoch of the checkpointing system,
and then committed through a two-phase protocol once all data is staged.
Currently the system does not cleanly recover from failures during the commit phase,
as this requires Kafka to be better able to participate in a two-phase commit.
See [this issue](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/issues/224) for more details.

## Kafka DDL

Kafka connection tables can be defined via SQL DDL and used as sources and sinks in
SQL queries.

For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  customer_id INT,
  order_id INT
) WITH (
  connector = 'kafka',
  format = 'json',
  bootstrap_servers = 'kafka-server-1.cluster:9092,kafka-server-2.cluster:9092',
  topic = 'order_topic',
  type = 'source',
  'source.offset' = 'earliest',
  'source.read_mode' = 'read_committed'
);
```
