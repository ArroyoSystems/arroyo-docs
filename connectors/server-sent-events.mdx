description: "Read from streaming HTTP sources"

[Server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) (also called EventSource)
is a simple mechanism to stream data over HTTP. Arroyo supports using SSE/EventSource APIs as sources. Arroyo will
attempt to provide exactly-once semantics on top of SSE by use of the `Last-Event-ID` header, but this relies on
proper implementation of the protocol by the server.

## Configuring the Connection

EventSource/SSE sources can be created via the Web UI or via the API as an HTTP connection

An HTTP connection has several required and optional fields:

| Field | Description | Required | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| name | A unique name for the connection | Yes | `my-server` |
| url | The base endpoint of the HTTP API | Yes | `https://api.example.com` |
| headers | A comma-separated list of colon separated key-value pairs of headers that will be sent to the server | No | ```Content-Type:application/json,Authorization: Bearer mytoken```

## Server-Sent Events Sources

SSE sources can be created via the UI, API, or directly in SQL. Schemas can be defined via json-schema,
read dynamically via SQL JSON functions, or described via SQL DDL.

When creating an SSE/EventSource source, the following options are supported:

| Option | Description | Required | Example |
| ------ | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| connection | The name of the HTTP connection to use | Yes | `my-server` |
| path | An optional path appended to the connection URL | No | `/v1/events` |
| events | An optional comma-separated list of events to listen for. If not set, all events will be used.| No | `event1,event2` |

In SQL, these options can be set when creating the table, along with a
`serialization_mode` that determines the format of the data (one of `json` or `raw_json`).

```sql
CREATE TABLE mastodon (
    value TEXT
)
WITH (
    connection = 'mstdn',
    path = '/v1/streaming/public',
    events = 'update',
    serialization_mode = 'raw_json');
```
