title: Server-Sent Events
description: "Read from streaming HTTP sources"

[Server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) (also called EventSource)
is a simple mechanism to stream data over HTTP. Arroyo supports using SSE/EventSource APIs as sources. Arroyo will
attempt to provide exactly-once semantics on top of SSE by use of the `Last-Event-ID` header, but this relies on
proper implementation of the protocol by the server.

## Configuring the Connection

SSE/EventSource sources can be created via the Web UI or directly in SQL.

An SSE connection has several required and optional fields:

| Field | Description | Required | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| endpoint | The endpoint for the SSE server | Yes | `https://api.example.com/v1/events` |
| headers | A comma-separated list of colon separated key-value pairs of headers that will be sent to the server | No | ```Content-Type:application/json,Authorization: Bearer mytoken```
| events | A comma-separated list of events to listen for. If not set, all events will be used.| No | `event1,event2` |

For example, in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mastodon (
    value TEXT
) /WITH (
    connector = 'sse',
    endpoint = 'https://api./v1/streaming/public',
    events = 'update',
    format = 'raw_string');
```
