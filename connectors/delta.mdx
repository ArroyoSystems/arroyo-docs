title: Delta Lake Sink
description: "Write Parquet files to a Delta Lake Table"
---

Data from Arroyo can be written to a Delta Lake table using the `delta` sink.
This sink shares most of its code with the [File System Sink](/connectors/filesystem),
and as such, it supports all of the same configuration options.

However, it has the following constraints:
* The `format` option must be set to `parquet`, as Delta Lake only supports Parquet files.
* Delta can only be used as a sink, not a source.
* Partitioning not integrated with the delta log.

## Commit Behavior
Arroyo commits to Delta Lake tables using the same two-phase commit protocol as the File System Sink.
This means that the data will only be visible to readers once the commit has completed successfully.
Idempotence is ensured by validating the table version before appending and if different than expected checking all 
intervining versions to ensure that the data was not already added.
