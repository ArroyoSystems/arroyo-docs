description: "Query results via the State API"

The State Sink turns Arroyo into a complete database by providing the ability to
query consistent snapshots of your pipeline state. This can be an attractive alternative
to hosting the results of your pipeline yourself.

The State Sink relies on the distributed state backend in Arroyo Cloud and is not currently
available in Arroyo OSS.

For more on how to use the state sink and state API, contact us at support@arroyo.systems.
