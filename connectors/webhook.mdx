The Webhook sink can send pipeline outputs to any HTTP server. This can be used
to connect Arroyo with a variety of web systems. Requests are sent as POSTS to the
configured endpoint. Headers be configured on the source, while the body is determined
by the SQL query using the specified format.

## Configuring the Connection

Polling HTTP sources can be created via the Web UI or directly in SQL.

A webhook connector has several required and optional fields:

| Field | Description | Required | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| endpoint | The endpoint for the HTTP server | Yes | `https://api.example.com/v1/webhook` |
| headers | A comma-separated list of colon separated key-value pairs of headers that will be sent to the server | No | ```Content-Type:application/json,Authorization: Bearer mytoken```


For example, we can send query outputs to a Slack channel via the Slack webhook API:

```sql
CREATE TABLE slack (
    text TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'webhook',
    endpoint = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXX/XXXXX/XXXXX',
    headers = 'Content-Type:application/json',
    format = 'json'
);
```
