description: "Use Amazon Kinesis streams as sources and sinks"

Arroyo provides sources and sinks for [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) for reading and writing data from Kinesis streams.
Kinesis's real-time data streaming capabilities make it a great fit for stream processing applications like Arroyo.

## Configuring the Connection

Kinesis connections can be created via the Web UI or via SQL.

A Kinesis connection has several required and optional fields:

| Field                                     | Description                                                               | Default Value    | Example     |
| -----------------------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------------| ----------- |
| stream_name                        | The Kinesis stream name for this table                                           | Must be specified| `my_stream` |
| source.offset                      | The offset to start reading from (either 'earliest' or 'latest')                 | `latest`         | `latest`    |
| sink.max_records_per_batch         | The number of records to batch together before writing to Kinesis                | `500`            | `100`       |
| sink.max_bytes_per_batch           | The maximum size of a batch of records to write to Kinesis                       | `4500000`        | `1000000`   |
| sink.flush_interval_millis         | The number of milliseconds to wait before flushing a batch of records to Kinesis | `1000`           | `1000`      |

## Kinesis Sources

Kinesis sources can be created via the Web UI, the API, or directly in SQL.
Kinesis sources implement exactly-once semantics by storing the last-read sequence number in Arroyo's state.
To query from Kinesis using SQL, use a CREATE TABLE statement like
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  customer_id INT,
  order_id INT
) WITH (
  connector = 'kinesis',
  stream_name = 'my_stream',
  type = 'source',
  format = 'json',
  'source.offset' = 'latest'
);
```

## Kinesis Sinks

Kinesis sinks can be created via the Web UI, the API, or directly in SQL.
To write to Kinesis from SQL, create a table with a CREATE TABLE statement like
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders_sink (
  customer_id INT,
  order_id INT
) WITH (
  connector = 'kinesis',
  stream_name = 'my_sink_stream',
  type = 'sink',
  format = 'json',
  'sink.max_records_per_batch' = 100,
  'sink.max_bytes_per_batch' = 5000000,
  'sink.flush_interval_millis' = 1000
);
```
