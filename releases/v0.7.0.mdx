# Overview

This release includes a number of new features, including custom partitioning
for the filesystem sink, message framing and unnest support, unions, state
compaction, and more. Our focus on quality also continues, with a more
sophisticated correctness test suite that can now test checkpointing and
restoration.

## What's next

With the 0.7 release out, we're already working on the next one. Arroyo 0.8 is
targeted for mid-November, and will include a number of new features, including
support for Avro, Delta Lake integration, a FileSystem source, saved UDFs, and
more. We've also been working on a new distributed state backend, which will
allow Arroyo to scale to multi-TB state sizes while maintaining fast restarts
and frequently checkpoints.

Now on to the details.

## Custom partitioning for FileSystem sink

Arroyo 0.5 added a high-performance, transactional
[filesystem sink](/connectors/filesystem) which enables
ingestion into data warehouses on S3. The initial version did not support
custom partitioning of data, so records were written to a single file per
subtask (with time and size-based rollovers).

In many cases, you will get better query performance if you partition your data
by a field in your data (like an event type) or by time.

Arroyo 0.7 introduces support for field-based and time-based partitioning, allowing
you to optimize your data layout according to your query patterns.

For example you can now create a table like this:

```sql {11-12}
CREATE TABLE file_sink (
    time TIMESTAMP,
    event_type TEXT,
    user_id TEXT,
    count INT
) WITH (
    connector = 'filesystem',
    format = 'parquet',
    path = 's3://arroyo-events/realtime',
    rollover_seconds = '3600',
    time_partition_pattern = 'year=%Y/month=%m/day=%d/hour=%H',
    partition_fields = 'event_type'
);
```

This will write data to a path like
`s3://arroyo-events/realtime/year=2023/month=10/day=19/hour=10/event_type=login`.

See all of the available options in the [docs](/connectors/filesystem#Partitioning_Options).

* Implement event time and field based partitioning for filesystem sink by
  [@jacksonrnewhouse](https://github.com/jacksonrnewhouse) in [#352](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/352)


## Message Framing

Arroyo now supports defining a _framing strategy_ for messages. This allows
users to customize how messages read off of a source are split into records for
processing, where previously there was always a one-to-one mapping. This is
particularly useful for sources which do not have a built-in framing strategy,
such as HTTP APIs.

As an example, Arroyo can now directly consume metrics from a
prometheus-compatible application—without using Prometheus! Here's a query that
polls a prometheus endpoint (for a node exporter) and computes the CPU usage
over a 1 minute sliding window:

```sql {8}
create table raw_metrics (
    value TEXT,
    parsed TEXT generated always as (parse_prom(value))
) WITH (
    connector = 'polling_http',
    endpoint = 'http://localhost:9100/metrics',
    format = 'raw_string',
    framing = 'newline',
    emit_behavior = 'changed',
    poll_interval_ms = '1000'
);

create table metrics as
    select extract_json_string(parsed, '$.name') as name,
        cast(extract_json_string(parsed, '$.value') as float) as value,
        get_first_json_object(parsed, '$.labels') as labels
    from raw_metrics;

create table cpu as
select
    extract_json_string(labels, '$.cpu') as cpu,
    extract_json_string(labels, '$.mode') as mode,
    value
from metrics
where name = 'node_cpu_seconds_total';

select sum(usage) from (
    select rate(value) as usage, cpu, mode,
        hop(interval '2 seconds', '60 seconds') as window
    from cpu
    where mode = 'user' or mode = 'system'
    group by cpu, mode, window);
```

This relies on the following UDFs:

<details>
<summary>`fn parse_prom(s: String) -> Option<String>`</summary>
```rust
/*
[dependencies]
regex = "1.10.2"
serde_json = "1.0"
*/

fn parse_prom(s: String) -> Option<String> {
    let regex = regex::Regex::new(r"(?P<metric_name>\w+)\{(?P<labels>[^}]+)\}\s+(?P<metric_value>[\d.]+)").unwrap();
    let label_regex = regex::Regex::new(r##"(?P<label>[^,]+)="(?P<value>[^"]+)""##).unwrap();

    let captures = regex.captures(&s)?;

    let name = captures.name("metric_name").unwrap().as_str();
    let labels = captures.name("labels").unwrap().as_str();
    let value = captures.name("metric_value").unwrap().as_str();

    let labels: std::collections::HashMap<String, String> = label_regex.captures_iter(&labels)
        .map(|capture| (
            capture.name("label").unwrap().as_str().to_string(),
            capture.name("value").unwrap().as_str().to_string()
        ))
        .collect();


    Some(serde_json::json!({
        "name": name,
        "labels": labels,
        "value": value
    }).to_string())
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>`fn rate(values: Vec<f32>) -> Option<f32>`</summary>
```rust
fn rate(values: Vec<f32>) -> Option<f32> {
    let start = values.first()?;
    let end = values.last()?;

    Some((end - start) / 60.0)
}
```
</details>

---

Currently we support framing via newlines (specified as `framing = 'newline'` in
SQL), although we plan to add support for other framing strategies in the
future.

See the [format docs](/connectors/overview#framing) for more.

* Add support for framing in message deserialization by
  [@mwylde](https://github.com/mwylde) in
  [#339](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/339)

## SQL unnest

While framing allows you to split a single message into multiple records, this
can only be applied at the source and for fairly simple framing rules. For other
use cases you may want to do some computation or parsing that produces an array,
and then unroll that array into multiple records.

This is what the new `unnest` operator does. It takes a column of type `Array`
and produces a new record for each element in the array. This is often useful
for dealing with JSON data, particularly from web APIs.

For example, the Github API doesn't provide a websocket feed of events, but it
does provide a REST API endpoint. We can use the `polling_http` connector along
with `unnest` to turn that into a stream:


```sql
CREATE TABLE raw_events (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'polling_http',
    endpoint = 'https://api.github.com/networks/arroyosystems/events',
    poll_interval_ms = '5000',
    emit_behavior = 'changed',
    headers = 'User-Agent:arroyo/0.7',
    format = 'json',
    'json.unstructured' = 'true'
);

create table events AS (
    select
        extract_json_string(event, '$.id') as id,
        extract_json_string(event, '$.type') as type,
        extract_json_string(event, '$.actor.login') as login,
        extract_json_string(event, '$.repo.name') as repo
    FROM
        (select unnest(extract_json(value, '$[*]'))
            as event from raw_events));

select concat(type, ' from ', login, ' in ', repo) FROM (
    select distinct(id), type, login, repo
    from events
);
```

* Implement unnest by [@mwylde](https://github.com/mwylde) in
  [#354](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/354)
* Support multiple projections from a single unnest by
  [@mwylde](https://github.com/mwylde) in
  [#366](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/366)

## SQL union

The `union` operator allows you to combine the results of multiple queries into
a single stream. This is often useful for combining similar data from multiple sources
(for example, two kafka streams); it can also be very useful for _bootstrapping_, which is
the process of processing historical data and then switching to a live stream.

For example, we can use `union` to combine two Kafka topics like this:

```sql
create table topic1 (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'kafka',
    topic = 'topic1',
    type = 'source',
    bootstrap_servers = 'localhost:9092',
    format = 'raw_string'
);

create table topic2 (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'kafka',
    topic = 'topic2',
    type = 'source',
    bootstrap_servers = 'localhost:9092',
    format = 'raw_string'
);

select value from topic1
union all select value from topic2;
```

* Support UNION by [@jacksonrnewhouse](https://github.com/jacksonrnewhouse) in
  [#346](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/346)
* Allow unions with matching types but different columns by
  [@jacksonrnewhouse](https://github.com/jacksonrnewhouse) in
  [#370](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/370)


## State compaction

Arroyo pipelines are stateful; operators like windows and joins need to remember things
in order to aggregate across time, and sources and sinks need to remember what data they've
already read or written to provide exactly-once semantics. While state is stored in memory
for processing, it also needs to be written durably so that it can be recovered in the event
of a failure. Today we write this state to local disk or to a remote object store like S3
as Parquet files.

This process of writing state to disk is called _checkpointing_ (you can read more about how this
works in [our docs](/concepts#stateful-processing)). Arroyo takes
frequent checkpoints (by default every ten seconds) to minimize the amount of data that needs
to be reprocessed in the case of failure. Arroyo's checkpointing is _incremental_, which means
that each checkpoint only contains the changes since the last checkpoint, but still involves writing a
new set of files.

Parquet files are immutable, which means that if a value is overwritten or deleted, it
remains in previous versions of the file. So over time, as we take more checkpoints, we end up
with more and more files on disk, and more and more data that needs to be read and processed
when we restart a pipeline.

To solve this problem, Arroyo now supports _compaction_, which is the process of merging
multiple Parquet files into a single file. By compacting our state files, we can actually delete
data, and resolve multiples writes to the same key into a single value while reducing the total
number of files.

Compaction is disabled by default for this release, but you can enable it by
setting the `COMPACTION_ENABLED` env var to `true`. Some workloads will not benefit from compaction,
but for others it can significantly reduce the storage costs of checkpoints and improve
recovery times.

* Allow compaction on previously compacted epochs by
  [@jbeisen](https://github.com/jbeisen) in
  [#328](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/328)
* Smoke test compaction and fix compaction logic by
  [@jbeisen](https://github.com/jbeisen) in
  [#332](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/332)
* Support delete operations for KeyTimeMultiMap by
  [@jbeisen](https://github.com/jbeisen) in
  [#338](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/338)
* Support deletes in the parquet backend by
  [@jbeisen](https://github.com/jbeisen) in
  [#282](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/282)

## Arroyo CLI

Arroyo now includes a CLI tool, `arroyo`, which currently can be used to manage
local Arroyo clusters. If you have [a rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/), you
can install it with

```console
$ cargo install arroyo
$ arroyo
Arroyo is a distributed stream processor that lets users ask complex
questions of high-volume real-time data by writing SQL.

This CLI can be used to run Arroyo clusters in Docker

Usage: arroyo <COMMAND>

Commands:
  start  Starts an Arroyo cluster in Docker
  stop   Stops a running Arroyo cluster
  help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

Then you can start an Arroyo cluster with

```console
$ arroyo start
```

We'll be adding more commands to the CLI in the future, including support for
interacting with the API to manage pipelines and run queries.

* Add arroyo cli crate (`arroyo`) by [@mwylde](https://github.com/mwylde) in
  [#333](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/333)

## Console onboarding and example queries

The console will now lead you through a short tour of the system when you first
open it, and includes a set of example queries to get you started. The example
queries can be found by clicking the "book" icon in the top right of the
create pipeline screen.

<img src="/posts/arroyo-0-7-0/examples.png" />


* Add example queries and short welcome tour by
  [@jbeisen](https://github.com/jbeisen) in
  [#348](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/348)


## UDF checking in the console

When writing Rust UDFs, it's easy to end up with compiler errors as you're developing. Arroyo
now checks UDFs for errors before starting the pipeline, and will show you the errors in the
console:

<img src="/posts/arroyo-0-7-0/udf-error.png" />

* Run cargo check on udfs by [@jbeisen](https://github.com/jbeisen) in [#359](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/359)

## Array indexing

Arroyo now supports indexing into arrays with subscript notation:

```sql
select make_array(1, 2, 3)[1]
from source;
```

* Support numeric indexes off of arrays by [@jacksonrnewhouse](https://github.com/jacksonrnewhouse) in [#364](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/364)

## Custom consumer groups for Kafka

The Kafka source now supports setting a custom consumer group name, which can be useful
when relying on Kafka's built-in offset tracking to start a new pipeline from where a
previous pipeline left off. Note that running multiple concurrent pipelines with the same
consumer group will result in each pipeline only receiving a subset of the data.

The consumer group for a Kafka source can be set in the console, or in SQL with the `group_id` option:

```sql {9}
create table source (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'kafka',
    topic = 'topic',
    type = 'source',
    bootstrap_servers = 'localhost:9092',
    format = 'raw_string',
    group_id = 'my_consumer_group'
);
```

* Adding support for custom consumer group by [@harshit2283](https://github.com/harshit2283) in [#325](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/325)

## Restarting failed pipelines

It's now possible to restart a pipeline that has failed. Pipelines can fail for a number of reasons,
including repeated problems talking to an external system, invalid data, or bugs in UDFs. When a pipeline
fails the controller will attempt to restart it automatically, but if the problem persists it will eventually
transition to the `failed` state and cease execution.

It's now possible to restart such pipelines from the console or via the new `/api/v1/pipelines/{id}/restart` endpoint.

* Add restarting state and pipeline restart API by [@mwylde](https://github.com/mwylde) in [#356](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/356)
