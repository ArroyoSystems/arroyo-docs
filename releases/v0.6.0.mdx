# Overview

Arroyo 0.6 is focused on quality. After a break-neck pace of new features in the
[past](https://arroyo.dev/blog/arroyo-0-5-0) [few](https://arroyo.dev/blog/arroyo-0-4-0)
[releases](https://arroyo.dev/blog/arroyo-0-3-0), we're taking a step back to focus on testing,
correctness, and stability. I'm particularly excited about our new SQL test
suite, which has uncovered a number of bugs and edge cases in our SQL support.

That said, it wouldn't be a new Arroyo release without some new features! We've
added support for Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and improved our Helm chart so that
Arroyo now runs well on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). We've also included a
couple of new connectors—a polling HTTP source and a webhook sink—that helps
Arroyo fit into companies that are earlier in their streaming journey. And we've
shipped the first version of our UDAF support, which allows you to write your
own SQL aggregate functions in Rust.

Thanks to all our contributors for this release:

## What's next

Now that 0.6 is out the door, we're already hard at work on the next release,
planned for mid-October. We're working on a number of exciting features and
improvements. We're adding support for accumulator-based UDAFS, which will allow
for efficient incremental calculations of aggregates. We're also working on
improvements to our checkpoint storage to support compaction and more efficient
deletes. And we'll be releasing a Postgres connector to allow directly writing
to Postgres tables without having to use Debezium.

Now on to the details.

# Features

## GCS/GKE

Arroyo has long supported Amazon S3 as a storage backend for storing pipeline
artifacts and checkpoints. With this release we're greatly expanding our storage
options, with support for Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and alternative
S3-compatible systems like [Minio](https://min.io) and
[Localstack](https://localstack.cloud/).

We've also made the way storage is configured more flexible and consistent, via
two environment variables: `CHECKPOINT_URL` and `ARTIFACT_URL`. These variables
can take a variety of URL forms, like:

* `s3://my-bucket`
* `s3::https://my-custom-s3:1234/my-bucket`
* `https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-bucket`
* `file:///my/local/filesystem`
* `gs://my-gcs-bucket`

See the
[docs](https://doc.arroyo.dev/deployment/kubernetes#example-gke-configuration)
for how to configure Arroyo on GKE.

* Add support for GCS and minio/localstack by @mwylde in [#296](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/296)

## User-defined aggregate functions

[SQL Aggregate functions](https://doc.arroyo.dev/sql/aggregate-functions) allow
you to compute summary statistics over a group of rows, like `SUM`, `AVG`, and
`COUNT`. Arroyo 0.6 adds initial support for user-defined aggregate functions (UDAFs)
which allow you to write your own aggregate functions in Rust.

For example, Arroyo doesn't include an aggregate function for computing Exponential
Moving Average (EMA), but now you can write your own:

```rust
fn ema(data: Vec<f64>) -> f64 {
    const alpha: f64 = 0.1;
    let mut ema = data[0] as f64;

    for i in 1..data.len() {
        let ema_value = alpha * data[i] as f64 + (1.0 - alpha) * ema;
        ema = ema_value;
    }

    ema
}
```

Currently only UDAFs over vectors are supported, but we plan to expand this to
support UDAFs that rely on partial aggregates and two-phase aggregations.

* implement UDAF support by @jacksonrnewhouse in [#312](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/312)

## Connectors

We've added two new connectors that are well suited for companies that are trying
to integrate Arroyo with HTTP-based systems, to complement our existing Server-Sent Events source
and Websocket sources.

### Polling HTTP source

The new [polling http source](https://doc.arroyo.dev/connectors/polling-http)
lets you turn any HTTP API into a streaming source. It periodically polls the endpoint,
and emits any new data into the stream.

For example, we're so excited whenever we get a new PR on Github and we want to
know about it as soon as possible. We can use the polling HTTP source to
periodically fetch our PRs and emit them whenever this changes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE prs (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'polling_http',
    endpoint = 'https://api.github.com/repos/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pulls?per_page=1&state=all',
    poll_interval_ms = '5000',
    emit_behavior = 'changed',
    headers = 'User-Agent:arroyo/0.6',
    format = 'json',
    'json.unstructured' = 'true'
);

SELECT extract_json_string(value, '$[0].url') as url
from prs;
```

* Polling http source by @mwylde in [#311](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/311)

### Webhook sink

On the other end of your application, we now have a [webhook sink](https://doc.arroyo.dev/connectors/webhook)
that lets you send pipeline results to any HTTP endpoint. This allows you to consume
outputs without needing to adopt streaming technologies like Kafka.

For example, we can build a simple Slack notification for our PRs using the webhook
sink and the source we defined above:

```sql
CREATE TABLE slack (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'webhook',
    endpoint = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXX/XXXXX/XXXXX',
    method = 'POST',
    headers = 'Content-Type:application/json',
    format = 'json',
    'json.unstructured' = 'true'
);

INSERT INTO slack
SELECT concat('A new PR was created ', extract_json_string(value, '$[0].url')) as text
from prs;
```

* Webhook sink by @mwylde in [#297](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/297)

## Rest API

We've finished our migration from gRPC to REST for the public-facing Arroyo API. As of
this release, all endpoints are now available via REST, and we've removed the gRPC
endpoint from the API service. New endpoints in this release include the ability to
create connections and fetch all job details including checkpoint information.

* Switch all connection endpoints to REST API by @jbeisen in [#242](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/242)
* Add pagination to pipelines and connection tables by @jbeisen in [#255](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/255)
* Switch checkpoint details to REST API by @jbeisen in [#265](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/265)
* Delete the GRPC API from the API service by @jbeisen in [#266](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/266)


## Raw string serialization

Arroyo supports a number of different
[serialization formats](https://doc.arroyo.dev/connectors/overview#connection-formats),
for handling data coming into and out of pipelines, including JSON, Parquet, and
raw strings. In this release we've added support for serializing arbitrary string data.
This is particularly powerful when combined with UDFs, which make it easy to construct
complex string-based formats that Arroyo doesn't natively support.

For example it's now possible to write a UDF that produces complex, nested JSON that
Arroyo's table schemas can't represent. For example:

```rust
/*
[dependencies]
serde_json = "1.0"
*/

fn my_to_json(f: f64) -> String {
    let v = serde_json::json!({
        "my_complex": {
            "nested_format": f
        }
    });

    serde_json::to_string(&v).unwrap()
}
```

* Add support for serializing raw_string formats by @mwylde in [#302](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/302)

# Improvements & Fixes

## SQL

As I mentioned in the introduction, this is really the meat of this release.
We've performed a major refactor to our SQL compiler that has fixed a number of
bugs and inconsistencies. And we've added a new set of SQL correctness tests
that perform end-to-end validation of our SQL implementation.

This work has uncovered a number of bugs and edge cases (fixed in this release)
and gives us much more confidence in the quality of our SQL support going forward.
