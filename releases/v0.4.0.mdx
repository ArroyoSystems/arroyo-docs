# Overview

Arroyo 0.4 brings some big new features like update tables, Debezium support,
and a major redesign of the connectors system that makes it much easier to build
new connectors. Leveraging that, we've added websocket and fluvio connectors.
We're also releasing the initial endpoints for our new REST API, which makes it
easier to build automations around Arroyo.

Read on for more details, and check out our [docs](https://doc.arroyo.dev) for
full details on existing and new features.

## What's next

With 0.4 out, we're already looking ahead to Arroyo 0.5, to be released in early
August. The headline feature of 0.5 will be the new Filesystem connector, which
will support high throughput, transactional writes from Arroyo into data
warehouses and data lakes backed by object stores like S3. We'll also be
finishing the transition to the new REST API, adding Redis and Kinesis
connectors, and adding a transactional Kafka sink. On the SQL side we'll be
working on session windows and support for joining on external tables.

# Features

## Update Tables

Arroyo 0.4 brings support for _update tables_. Exactly what that means is a bit
complicated (and we'll dive into it below) but the short version is that you can
now use Arroyo to efficiently read and write data from databases like Postgres
and MySQL via [Debezium](https://debezium.io/), and many queries that were
previously unsupported are now supported.

So what are update tables? Let's talk through the semantics of Arroyo tables
today, which we'll call _append tables_ going forward.

Take this query:

```sql
SELECT store_id, status from orders;
```

which produces this output stream:

```
Time                        store     status
7/10/23, 11:34:34 AM PDT    1142      "accepted"
7/10/23, 11:34:34 AM PDT    1737      "accepted"
7/10/23, 11:34:34 AM PDT    1149      "accepted"
```

This query will output one row for every record that comes in on the orders stream
(let's say that's a kafka topic that receives every order). You can think of this
as modeling a virtual table with three columns (time, store, and status). Each
new order that comes in produces a new row in that table, or in other words
is _appended_.

But what if we have a query that needs other operations beside appends? For
example, consider this query:

```sql
SELECT store, count(*) AS count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer;
```

which models a table with one row per customer. When a new order comes in,
we may append a new row if it's a new customer, or we may need to update an existing
row if we've already seen that customer. In other words, we need to support _updates_.

In Arroyo 0.3 that query is not supported, but in 0.4 it will produce an update
stream that looks like this:

```
Time                     previous                              current                               op
7/10/23, 4:03:42 PM PDT  { "orders_store_id": 3, "count": 1 }  { "orders_store_id": 3, "count": 2 }  "u"
7/10/23, 4:03:40 PM PDT  null	                               { "orders_store_id": 1, "count": 1 }  "c"
7/10/23, 4:03:40 PM PDT  null                                  { "orders_store_id": 3, "count": 1 }  "c"
```

Each output records an update of some kind, either a [c]reate, [u]pdate, or
[d]elete. This stream can be used directly, or it can be used to materialize the
output into another database like Postgres or MySQL via Debezium, which natively
supports this kind of update stream.

Update tables can also be used with Debezium to write to Arroyo from a SQL
database CDC source. See the new
[Debezium tutorial](https://doc.arroyo.dev/tutorial/debezium) for more details
on how to set this up.

Beyond use with Debezium, update tables can also be very useful for efficiently
implementing queries where it's important to know when some key enters or leaves
a set. For example, for a fraud detection system you may have a set of rules that
indicate possibly-fraudulent activity, like this query which looks for sites with
suspiciously high click-through rates:

```sql
SELECT site as suspicious_site
FROM (
    SELECT site, clicks / impressions as click_through_rate
    FROM (SELECT site,
        SUM(CASE
            WHEN imp_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as clicks,
        SUM(CASE
            WHEN imp_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as impressions
        FROM event_stream
    GROUP BY 1)
) WHERE click_through_rate > 0.02;
```

This query will produce a record with `"op": "c"` whenever a site first exceeds the
threshold, and `"op": "d"` whenever a site falls below the threshold.

## Connector redesign

Connectors integrate Arroyo with external systems. They implement _sources_ that
read data from external systems and _sinks_ that write data to external systems.

Arroyo 0.4 brings a major redesign of the connectors system, making it much
easier to build new connectors. In previous releases of Arroyo, connectors
were deeply integrated with the various Arroyo sub-systems (the console, api,
database, sql planner, compiler, etc.) and adding or modifying a connector
required changes to all of those systems.

In 0.4, connector implementations are cleanly separated out into the new
`arroyo-connectors` crate. New connectors can be created by implementing a
[simple trait](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/blob/2090cb97024ddaafcdc04bd79bb7e31f867178ae/arroyo-connectors/src/lib.rs#L67).

This redesign has allowed us to add a number of new connectors in 0.4 (detailed
below), and will accelerate our connector development going forward.

We've also revamped the UI experience around creating sources and sinks, which
are now jointly managed in the new _Connections_ tab in the console. This
provides a more straightforward experience for creating and managing
connections.

Finally, DDL for creating sources and sinks has also been updated to be more
consistent and easier to use. For example, a Kafka source can be created with
the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  customer_id INT,
  order_id INT
) WITH (
  connector = 'kafka',
  format = 'json',
  bootstrap_servers = 'broker-1.cluster:9092,broker-2.cluster:9092',
  topic = 'order_topic',
  type = 'source',
  'source.offset' = 'earliest'
);
```

## New connectors

Arroyo 0.4 includes a number of new connectors leveraging the connector redesign.
See the [connector docs](https://doc.arroyo.dev/connectors) the full list of
supported connectors.

### Websocket sources

Arroyo 0.4 adds a new Websocket source, which allows Arroyo to read data from
the many available websocket APIs.

For example, Coinbase provides a
[websocket API](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/exchange/docs/websocket-overview)
that streams the full orderbook for various cryptocurrencies. We can use the new
Websocket source to stream that data into Arroyo, and perform real-time analytics
on it.

As a simple example, this query computes the average price of Bitcoin in USD
over the last minute:

```sql
CREATE TABLE coinbase (
    type TEXT,
    price TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'websocket',
    endpoint = 'wss://ws-feed.exchange.coinbase.com',
    subscription_message = '{
      "type": "subscribe",
      "product_ids": [
        "BTC-USD"
      ],
      "channels": ["ticker"]
    }',
    format = 'json'
);

SELECT avg(CAST(price as FLOAT)) from coinbase
WHERE type = 'ticker'
GROUP BY hop(interval '5' second, interval '1 minute');
```

### Fluvio source/sink

Arroyo 0.4 adds a new Fluvio source and sink, which allows Arroyo to read and
write data from [Fluvio](https://www.fluvio.io/), a high-performance distributed
streaming platform built on top of Rust and Kubernetes.

Fluvio has support for simple, stateless processing, but with Arroyo it can be
extended to perform complex, stateful processing and analytics.

## REST API

Today Arroyo is primarily used through the web console, which is great for individual
users and small teams. But for more advanced use cases and larger orgs it's important
to build automation and integrate Arroyo with internal infrastructure.

Arroyo has always provided a gRPC API that controls all aspects of the system.
This is the API that powers the console. But gRPC can be difficult to work with,
and it isn't widely supported by existing tools and libraries. We also haven't
treated the gRPC API as a stable interface and have made regular breaking
changes.

So with this release, we're starting the process of migrating the API to REST,
and making it a first-class, stable interface for Arroyo. Arroyo 0.4 adds the
first REST endpoints that support pipeline creation, management, and inspection.
For example, a SQL pipeline can be created with the following curl command:

```bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:8003/v1/pipelines \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "orders",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM orders;"
    "udfs": [],
    "parallelism": 1,
  }'
```

See the [REST API docs](https://doc.arroyo.dev/api-reference/overview) for more details.

In future releases we'll continue to expand the REST API to cover all aspects of
Arroyo, and will eventually deprecate the gRPC API.
