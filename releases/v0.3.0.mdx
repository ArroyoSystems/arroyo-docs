title: v0.3.0
description: "Release 0.3.0 of Arroyo"
---

We're thrilled to announce the 0.3.0 release of Arroyo, our second minor release
as an open-source project. Arroyo is a state-of-the-art stream processing engine
designed to allow anyone to build complex, stateful real-time data pipelines
with SQL.

# Overview

The Arroyo 0.3 release focused on improving the flexibility of the system and
completeness of SQL support, with the MVP for UDF support, DDL statements, and
custom event time and watermarks. There have also many substantial improvements
to the Web UI, including error reporting, backpressure monitoring, and under-the-hood
infrastructure improvements.

We've also greatly expanded our docs since the last release. Check them out at
https://doc.arroyo.dev.

## New contributors

We are excited to welcome three new contributors to the project with this release:

- [@haoxins](https://github.com/haoxins) made their first contribution in [#100](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/100)
- [@edmondop](https://github.com/edmondop) made their first contribution in [#122](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/122)
- [@chenquan](https://github.com/chenquan) made their first contribution in [#147](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/147)

Thanks to all new and existing contributors!

## What's next

Looking forward to the 0.4 release, we have a lot of exciting changes planned.
We're adding the ability to create _updating tables_ with native support for Debezium,
allowing users to connect Arroyo to relational databases like MySQL and Postgres. Other
planned features include external joins, session windows, and Delta Lake integration.

Excited to be part of the future of stream processing? Come chat with the team
on our [discord](https://discord.gg/cjCr5rVmyR), check out a [starter
issue](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
and submit a PR, and let us know what you'd like to see next in Arroyo\!

# Features

## UDFs

With this release we are shipping initial support for writing user-defined
functions (UDFs) in Rust, allowing users to extend SQL with custom business
logic. See the [udf docs](https://doc.arroyo.dev/sql/udfs) for full details.

For example, we can register a Rust function:

```rust
// Returns the great-circle distance between two coordinates
fn gcd(lat1: f64, lon1: f64, lat2: f64, lon2: f64) -> f64 {
    let radius = 6371.0;

    let dlat = (lat2 - lat1).to_radians();
    let dlon = (lon2 - lon1).to_radians();

    let a = (dlat / 2.0).sin().powi(2) +
        lat1.to_radians().cos() *
            lat2.to_radians().cos() *
                (dlon / 2.0).sin().powi(2);
    let c = 2.0 * a.sqrt().atan2((1.0 - a).sqrt());

    radius * c
}
```

and call it from SQL:

```sql
SELECT gcd(src_lat, src_long, dst_lat, dst_long)
FROM orders;
```

  - MVP of Rust UDFs by [@mwylde](https://github.com/mwylde) in [#104](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/104)

## SQL DDL statements

It's now possible to define sources and sinks directly in SQL via
[CREATE TABLE statements](https://doc.arroyo.dev/sql/ddl#create-table-connection):

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  customer_id INT,
  order_id INT,
  date_string TEXT
) WITH (
  connection = 'my_kafka',
  topic = 'order_topic',
  serialization_mode = 'json'
);
```

These tables can then be selected from and inserted into to read and write from
those systems. For example, we can duplicate the orders topic by inserting from
it into a new table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders_copy (
  customer_id INT,
  order_id INT,
  date_string TEXT
) WITH (
  connection = 'my_kafka',
  topic = 'order_topic',
  serialization_mode = 'json'
);


INSERT INTO orders_copy SELECT * FROM orders;
```

In addition to connection tables, this release also adds support for views and
virtual tables, which are helpful for splitting up complex queries into smaller
components.

  - Feature/inline create table by [@jacksonrnewhouse](https://github.com/jacksonrnewhouse) in
    [#101](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/101)
  - Rework sources and sinks to allow for creating tables/views in SQL queries
    by [@jacksonrnewhouse](https://github.com/jacksonrnewhouse) in [#107](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/107)


## Custom event time and watermarks

Arroyo now supports custom event time fields and watermarks, allowing users to
define their own event time fields and watermarks based on the data in their
streams.

When creating a connection table in SQL, it is now possible to define a _virtual
field_ generated from the data in the stream and then assign that to be the event time.
We can then generate a watermark from that event time field as well.

A complete example looks like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  customer_id INT,
  order_id INT,
  date_string TEXT,
  event_time TIMESTAMP GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CAST(date_string as TIMESTAMP)),
  watermark TIMESTAMP GENERATED ALWAYS AS (event_time - INTERVAL '15' SECOND)
) WITH (
  connection = 'my_kafka',
  topic = 'order_topic',
  serialization_mode = 'json',
  event_time_field = 'event_time',
  watermark_field = 'watermark'
);
```

For more on the underlying concepts of event times and watermarks, see the
[concept docs](https://doc.arroyo.dev/concepts#timely-processing).

  - Support virtual fields and overriding timestamp via event_time_field by
    [@jacksonrnewhouse](https://github.com/jacksonrnewhouse) in [#127](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/127)
  - Add ability to configure watermark by specifying a specific override column.

## Additional SQL features

Beyond UDFs and DDL statements, we have continued to expand the completeness of
our SQL support with addition of case statements and regex functions:

- Allow filters on join computations by [@jacksonrnewhouse](https://github.com/jacksonrnewhouse) in
  [#131](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/131)
- Implement CASE statements by [@jacksonrnewhouse](https://github.com/jacksonrnewhouse) in
  [#146](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/146)
- Adding support for regex_replace and regex_match by [@edmondop](https://github.com/edmondop) in
  [#122](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/122)
- Rework top N window functions by [@jacksonrnewhouse](https://github.com/jacksonrnewhouse) in
  [#136](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/136)

## Server-Sent Events source

We've added a new source which allows reading from
[Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)
APIs (also called EventSource). SSE is a simple protocol for streaming data from
HTTP servers and is a common choice for web applications. See the
[SSE source documentation](https://doc.arroyo.dev/connectors/server-sent-events)
for more details, and take a look at the new
[Mastodon trends](https://doc.arroyo.dev/tutorial/mastodon) tutorial that makes
uses of it
