## Architecture overview

The Arroyo system architecture is composed of several services, as can be seen in the following diagram:

![Arroyo Architecture](/images/arroyo_arch.png)

### web ui

The web ui is a single-page app written in react that interacts with the system via the gRPC API. It allows users to
configure the system, create pipelines, and monitor their statuses.

### arroyo-api

The API server backs the web ui and handles all configuration operations and pipeline management. It exposes a gRPC APIs
(defined in [api.proto](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/blob/master/arroyo-rpc/proto/api.proto)).

API operations, like creating a pipeline or updating its state operate soley by updating the configuration in
the postgres database. This is asynchronously applied to the actual state of the environment by the controller. The API
itself is stateless and does not communicate with the rest of the system except via the database.

### arroyo-controller

The controller runs a control loop that continuously reconciles the desired state of the system (as defined in the database)
with the actual state of the system, as determined by monitoring the environment. This is similar to a Kubernetes
controller, (see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) for an overview of this pattern.

There is a single controller instance that runs in the system, and high-availability is not yet supported in the open
source release. If the controller instance fails, the workers will eventually stop and wait for the controller to come
back online.

The controller manages a state machine for each job, which is documented [here](#state-machine) and is also responsible
for initiating checkpoints on the workers. Communication between the controller and workers is done via the gRPC API
defined in [rpc.proto](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/blob/master/arroyo-rpc/proto/rpc.proto).

### schedulers

Arroyo supports multiple schedulers, which are responsible for running the workers that make up the dataflow engine.
The scheduler can be set by setting the `SCHEDULER` environment variable for the controller.

#### process

The process scheduler is the default, and is most useful for local development. In this mode, the controller will spawn
processes locally to run the workers.

#### node

Arroyo comes with a lightweight scheduler and node runtime for running distributed workers. In this mode, you must start
some number of arroyo-node processes (for example, in an autoscaling group) and configure them with the controller's
address. The controller will then schedule workers on these nodes.

#### nomad

Arroyo can also be configured to schedule workers on a [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) cluster. This is currently
the recommended mode for production usage, and is what we run in production for [Arroyo Cloud](https://arroyo.dev/).

#### kubernetes

Support for scheduling workers on a Kubernetes cluster is coming soon.

### arroyo-worker

Workers run the actual processing logic, making up the dataplane. Workers run a binary that is produced by linking
Rust code generated from the SQL query with the arroyo-worker library. Workers within the same pipeline are connected
via TCP connections over which dataflow occurs. Each worker is configured with a number of slots, which controls how
many subtasks it may run. By default, each slot runs a parallel slice of the entire DAG, which generally does a good
job of balancing the load across workers.

The controller is responsible for scheduling the necessary number of workers to run a pipeline, initiating checkpoints,
monitoring their health, and recovering from failures.

### postgres

Arroyo uses Postgres to store configuration (sources, connections, sinks, pipelines, etc) and the status of the system.
This drives the API, and is also used by the controller to drive the reconciliation loop.

### prometheus

Arroyo uses Prometheus for metrics collection. This powers the metrics dashboard in the web ui. It also relies on the
prometheus pushgateway to collect metrics from workers.

### S3

Checkpoints are stored on S3 for recovery.

## Job State Machine

Jobs are managed via a statemachine that is implemented in the controller:

![Job State Machine](/images/diagrams/state_machine.d2.svg)

Jobs are initialized in the `Created` state when they are created via the API. Once the controller loads the job, it
will begin managing it, and is responsible for moving it to a terminal state (like Running, Stopped, Failed) within a
bounded amount of time.
