title: Streaming Windows
description: 'Rolling up data by time in SQL'

Because of the unbounded nature of event streams, it is common to aggregate data
over a time window. There are a number of types of windows that are used in
stream processing systems. Currently Arroyo supports three kinds of windows:
_sliding_ (aka hopping), _tumbling_, and _session_ windows.

Using a streaming window makes the query time and watermark aware. See the
[timely processing](/concepts#timely-processing) docs for more background,
and our [streaming SQL explained](https://www.arroyo.dev/blog/streaming-sql-explained)
blog post for more details on how using windows affects query semantics.

## Tumbling Windows

Tumbling windows are consecutive, non-overlapping windows of a fixed size.
Usually that size will be some human-friendly time unit like minutes or hours,
but that isn't a requirement. Whereas in normal SQL you might group by a `date_trunc` call,
in streaming SQL you'd use a tumbling window.

In Arroyo windowing is enabled via special UDFs, in this case `TUMBLE()`.
For example, to get the number of distinct auction IDs across bids for each minute,
you'd write a query like

```sql
SELECT TUMBLE(interval '1 minute') as window,
    COUNT(DISTINCT auction_id) AS num_auctions
    FROM bids
    GROUP BY window
```

Every record in Arroyo has a corresponding timestamp,
which will be processed by the `TUMBLE()` function.
The resulting records will have a timestamp of
the end of the window minus 1 nanosecond.


## Sliding Windows
Sliding windows are an extension of tumbling windows, with the addition of a
"slide". It is defined by two time durations, a width for each window and a
slide that designates the time between the start of consecutive windows.
Typically the slide is less than the window. A sliding window can be used to
provide a view of data over some lookback time (the width), updated with some
frequency (the slide).

In Arroyo the `HOP()` function is used to create sliding windows.
It takes two arguments, the first is the slide and the second is the window size.

For example, to get the number of distinct auction IDs across bids for the previous minute every second,
you'd write a query like

```sql
SELECT HOP(interval '1 second', interval '1 minute') as window,
    COUNT(DISTINCT auction_id) AS num_auctions
    FROM bids
    GROUP BY 1
```

Arroyo has optimized sliding windows so that each hop only needs to perform an incremental amount of work,
allowing for long sliding windows with small hops.

## Session Windows

Session windows are non-fixed-width windows that are defined by a gap in
activity. For example, a session window with gap size 30 minutes, defined on a
stream of user clicks might be would aggregate over all clicks that occur within
30 minutes of each other. Once there has been a 30 minute gap for a given user,
the session window would close and a new one would be opened for the next
click.

In Arroyo the `SESSION()` function is used to create session windows.

For example, to get the number of distinct auction IDs across bids for each session,

```sql
SELECT SESSION(interval '30 minutes') as window,
    COUNT(DISTINCT auction_id) AS num_auctions
    FROM bids
    GROUP BY 1
```

As of Arroyo 0.5, session windows are limited to a maximum size of 24 hours. If a
window is open for longer than that, it will be closed and a new one will be
opened.
