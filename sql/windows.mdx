title: Windowed Data in SQL
description: 'Rolling up data by time in SQL'

Because of the unbounded nature of event streams, 
it is common to aggregate data over a time window.
There are a number of types of windows that are used in stream processing systems.
Currently Arroyo supports _sliding_ and _tumbling_ windows.

## Tumbling Windows
Tumbling windows are consecutive, non-overlapping windows of a fixed size.
Usually that size will be some human-friendly time unit like minutes or hours, 
but that isn't a requirement. Where in normal SQL you might group by a `date_trunc` call, 
in streaming SQL you'd use a hop window.

In Arroyo windowing is enabled via special UDFs, in this case `TUMBLE()`.
For example, to get the number of distinct auction IDs across bids for each minute,
you'd write a query like
    
    ```sql
    SELECT TUMBLE(interval '1 minute') as window,
        COUNT(DISTINCT auction_id) AS num_auctions
        FROM bids
        GROUP BY 1
    ```

Every record in Arroyo has a corresponding timestamp, 
which will be processed by the `TUMBLE()` function.
Similar to Flink, the resulting records will have a timestamp of
the end of the window minus 1 nanosecond.


## Sliding Windows
Sliding windows are an extension of tumbling windows, with the addition of a "slide".
It is defined by two time durations,
a width for each window and 
a slide that designates the time between the start of consecutive windows.
Typically the slide is less than the window. 
A sliding window can be used to provide a view of data over some lookback time (the width), 
updated with some frequency (the slide).

In Arroyo the `HOP()` function is used to create sliding windows. 
It takes two arguments, the first is the slide and the second is the window size.

For example, to get the number of distinct auction IDs across bids for the previous minute every second,
you'd write a query like

        ```sql
        SELECT HOP(interval '1 second', interval '1 minute') as window,
            COUNT(DISTINCT auction_id) AS num_auctions
            FROM bids
            GROUP BY 1
        ```

Arroyo has optimized sliding windows so that each hop only needs to perform an incremental amount of work, 
allowing for long sliding windows with small hops.
