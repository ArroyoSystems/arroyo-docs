## `digest`

Computes the binary hash of an expression using the specified algorithm.

```
digest(expression, algorithm)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression**: String expression to operate on.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of string operators.
- **algorithm**: String expression specifying algorithm to use.
  Must be one of:

  - md5
  - sha224
  - sha256
  - sha384
  - sha512
  - blake2s
  - blake2b
  - blake3

## `md5`

Computes an MD5 128-bit checksum for a string expression.

```
md5(expression)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression**: String expression to operate on.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of string operators.

## `sha224`

Computes the SHA-224 hash of a binary string.

```
sha224(expression)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression**: String expression to operate on.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of string operators.

## `sha256`

Computes the SHA-256 hash of a binary string.

```
sha256(expression)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression**: String expression to operate on.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of string operators.

## `sha384`

Computes the SHA-384 hash of a binary string.

```
sha384(expression)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression**: String expression to operate on.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of string operators.

## `sha512`

Computes the SHA-512 hash of a binary string.

```
sha512(expression)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression**: String expression to operate on.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of string operators.
