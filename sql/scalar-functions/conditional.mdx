_Arroyo's Scalar function implementations are based on
[Apache DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) and these docs are derived from
the DataFusion function reference._

## `coalesce`

Returns the first of its arguments that is not _null_.
Returns _null_ if all arguments are _null_.
This function is often used to substitute a default value for _null_ values.

```
coalesce(expression1[, ..., expression_n])
```

**Arguments**

- **expression1, expression_n**:
  Expression to use if previous expressions are _null_.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of arithmetic operators.
  Pass as many expression arguments as necessary.

## `nullif`

Returns _null_ if _expression1_ equals _expression2_; otherwise it returns _expression1_.
This can be used to perform the inverse operation of [`coalesce`](#coalesce).

```
nullif(expression1, expression2)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression1**: Expression to compare and return if equal to expression2.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of arithmetic operators.
- **expression2**: Expression to compare to expression1.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of arithmetic operators.

## `nvl`

Returns _expression2_ if _expression1_ is NULL; otherwise it returns _expression1_.

```
nvl(expression1, expression2)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression1**: return if expression1 not is NULL.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of arithmetic operators.
- **expression2**: return if expression1 is NULL.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of arithmetic operators.

## `nvl2`

Returns _expression2_ if _expression1_ is not NULL; otherwise it returns _expression3_.

```
nvl2(expression1, expression2, expression3)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression1**: conditional expression.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of arithmetic operators.
- **expression2**: return if expression1 is not NULL.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of arithmetic operators.
- **expression3**: return if expression1 is NULL.
  Can be a constant, column, or function, and any combination of arithmetic operators.

## `ifnull`

_Alias of [nvl](#nvl)._
