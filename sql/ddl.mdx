In addition to its SELECT capabilities Arroyo supports several Data Description Language (DDL) capabilities.

## CREATE TABLE

Arroyo's CREATE TABLE statements come in three flavors: Create Table As, Memory Table and Connection Table.

### CREATE TABLE AS

This command creates a table from the query included in it, e.g.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders AS SELECT customer_id, order_id FROM orders;
```

The schema is inferred from the query and other queries within the same context can select from the new table.

### CREATE TABLE (In-Memory)

CREATE TABLE statements without any connection info are presumed to be in
memory. It can be written to within the same query context and then read from. A
memory table may be used in only one `INSERT INTO` statement, but can then be
selected from multiple times. For example, you could create an `orders` table
with a statement like

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (customer_id INT, order_id INT);
```

`CREATE VIEW` is simply an alias for creating a memory table.

### CREATE TABLE (Connection)

Connection tables allow Arroyo to read and write to external systems like Kafka
clusters. Connection tables may be used as sources or sinks depending on
the type of connection. For details on all of the supported connectors, see the
[Connectors](/connectors) docs. Connection tables can be created via the
Connections tabs of the Web UI, or directly in SQL via the `CREATE TABLE`
statement.

Connection tables are created via special `CREATE TABLE` statements that include
a `WITH` clause. The `WITH` clause specifies the connector, the
[format](/connectors/formats) that the data is encoded with, and various other
options that are specific to the connector, as documented on the individual
connector pages. The general form of the statement is:

```sql
CREATE TABLE <table name> (
  [<field name> <field type>,]*
  [WATERMARK FOR <field_name> [AS <expression>]]
) WITH (
  connector = '<connector name>',
  format = '<format name>',
  [format options]
  [connector options]
)
```

where `connector` is one of the connectors documented [here](/connectors) and
format is one of of the [supported formats](/connectors/formats).

For example, to create a Kafka source for the topic `order_topic`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  customer_id INT,
  order_id INT,
  date_string TEXT
) WITH (
  connector = 'kafka',
  format = 'json',
  type = 'source',
  bootstrap_servers = 'localhost:9092',
  topic = 'order_topic'
);
```

For full details on how to create connection tables, see the
[connector docs](/connectors).

#### Schema inference

When creating a connection table, you can specify the schema explicitly by listing
fields in the CREATE TABLE statement, or you can let Arroyo infer the schema from
how it's used. This is mostly relevant for sinks, where the schema can be inferred
from the query that writes to the table.

For example, a Kafka sink could be created like this

```sql
CREATE TABLE results WITH (
  connector = 'kafka',
  format = 'json',
  type = 'sink',
  bootstrap_servers = 'localhost:9092',
  topic = 'results'
);
```

and written to like this

```sql
INSERT INTO results
SELECT customer_id as customer_id, count(*) as count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id, TUMBLE(INTERVAL '1' HOUR);
```

That will result in records like this being written to the `results` topic

```json
{"customer_id": 1, "count": 10}
{"customer_id": 2, "count": 5}
```

Schema-inferred sinks can also be created in the Web UI by selecting the "infer schema"
option when creating the table.

Note that when relying on schema inference, the column names will be determined
by the query, so you will generally want to alias them using `as` to ensure they
are what you expect.


#### Options

Connection tables allow you to configure a number of options that specify and
modify the behavior. They are specified via the `WITH` clause, with an unquoted
key and a single or double-quoted value. The following options are supported
across all connections. Specific connections have their own options. To see all
of the supported options, refer to the [Connector](/connectors) docs.


| Option           | required  | Description |
|--------          | --------- |-------------|
| `connector`      | yes  | The name of the connector to use.|
| `format`         | if connector does not have a built-in format  | The format of the data to be deserialized. |
| `idle_micros`    | no  | The number of microseconds to wait before considering a source idle. Defaults to `30000000` (30 seconds). Set to `-1` to disable source idleness.|

#### Virtual Fields

Virtual fields can be created within the `CREATE TABLE` statement. These are
done using the `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (expression)` syntax. `expression` must be a
valid Arroyo SQL expression that only depends on non-virtual fields within the
table. For example

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id TEXT,
  event_type TEXT,
  user_id TEXT,
  key TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (concat(id, '-', user_id))
) WITH (
  ...
)
```

## INSERT INTO

Arroyo supports INSERT INTO statements for both memory and connection tables. In
line with standard SQL the insertion will happen column-wise, attempting
coercion to the SQL types. For example, if you have a memory table `orders` with
columns `customer_id` and `order_id` you could insert into it with a statement
like

```sql
INSERT INTO orders SELECT customer, order FROM source_table;
```

If the table is a connection table this will result in a sink,
otherwise it will be a memory table that can then be read from.
