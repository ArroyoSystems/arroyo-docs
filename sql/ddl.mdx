In addition to its SELECT capabilities Arroyo supports several Data Description Language (DDL) capabilities.

## CREATE TABLE
Arroyo's CREATE TABLE statements come in three flavors: Create Table As, Memory Table and Connection Table.
### CREATE TABLE AS
This comamnd creates a table from the query included in it, e.g.
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders AS SELECT customer_id, order_id FROM orders;
```
The schema is inferred from the query and other queries within the same context can select from the new table.
### CREATE TABLE (In-Memory)
CREATE TABLE statements without any connection info are presumed to be in memory.
It can be written to within the same query context and then read from. 
Currently you can only insert into a given memory table once, but multiple sources can then select from it.
For example, you could create an `orders` with a statement like
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (customer_id INT, order_id INT);
```
At present, `CREATE VIEW` is simply an alias for creating a memory table.
### CREATE TABLE (Connection)
If you want to read or write using a pre-defined connection 
this is done by including a WITH clause in the CREATE TABLE statement. 
This should include the connection name and any other arguments needed to instantiate the connection,
such as the kafka topic. For example, i you have a kafka connection my_kafka and want to output to order_topic, 
you could write
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  customer_id INT,
  order_id INT)
 WITH (
  connection='my_kafka',
  topic='order_topic');
```
## INSERT INTO
Arroyo supports INSERT INTO statements for both memory and connection tables.
In line with standard SQL the insertion will happen column-wise,
 attempting coercion to the SQL types.
For example, if you have a memory table `orders` with columns `customer_id` and `order_id`
you could insert into it with a statement like
```sql
INSERT INTO orders SELECT customer, order FROM source_table;
```
If the table is a connection table this will result in a sink,
otherwise it will be a memory table that can then be read from.
