In addition to its SELECT capabilities Arroyo supports several Data Description Language (DDL) capabilities.

## CREATE TABLE
Arroyo's CREATE TABLE statements come in three flavors: Create Table As, Memory Table and Connection Table.

### CREATE TABLE AS
This command creates a table from the query included in it, e.g.
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders AS SELECT customer_id, order_id FROM orders;
```
The schema is inferred from the query and other queries within the same context can select from the new table.

### CREATE TABLE (In-Memory)
CREATE TABLE statements without any connection info are presumed to be in memory.
It can be written to within the same query context and then read from. 
A memory table may be used in only one `INSERT INTO` statement, but can then be selected from multiple times.
For example, you could create an `orders` table with a statement like

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (customer_id INT, order_id INT);
```

`CREATE VIEW` is simply an alias for creating a memory table.

### CREATE TABLE (Connection)
Connection tables allow Arroyo to read and write to external systems like Kafka clusters. 
Connection tables can be created either in the Source and Sink tabs of the Web UI, 
or directly within SQL via a CREATE TABLE call.

To create a connection table in SQL,
you must have already configured the the connection information in the Connections tab 
so that Arroyo knows how to connect and authenticate against the external system.
Each configured connection has a name, which is then referenced within the CREATE TABLE call.
The general from is

```sql
CREATE TABLE <table name> (
  [<field name> <field type>,]..
) WITH (
  connection = '<connection name>',
  [connection options]
)
```

For example, to create a table that can read and write from 
a Kafka connection called my_kafka and a Kafka topic order_topic:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  customer_id INT,
  order_id INT)
 WITH (
  connection = 'my_kafka',
  topic = 'order_topic',
  format = 'json'
);
```

## INSERT INTO
Arroyo supports INSERT INTO statements for both memory and connection tables.
In line with standard SQL the insertion will happen column-wise,
 attempting coercion to the SQL types.
For example, if you have a memory table `orders` with columns `customer_id` and `order_id`
you could insert into it with a statement like
```sql
INSERT INTO orders SELECT customer, order FROM source_table;
```
If the table is a connection table this will result in a sink,
otherwise it will be a memory table that can then be read from.
