title: User-defined Aggregate Functions (UDAFs)
description: 'Implement custom aggregation logic in Arroyo SQL with UDAFs'
---

Arroyo SQL supports User-Defined Aggregate Functions, allowing you to extend the
system's capabilities with custom aggregation logic written in Rust. UDAFs are
deployed and managed in the same way as scalar UDFs; see the [/sql/udfs](UDF
docs) for details.

## Defining a UDAF

UDAFs are defined as functions that take some number of `Vec<T>` as an
argument, where `T` is any valid [SQL data type](/sql/data-types).

### Example

Here's a simple UDAF for calculating the median of a set of integers:

```rust
use arroyo_sql_plugin::udf;

#[udf]
fn my_median(mut args: Vec<i64>) -> Option<f64> {
    if args.is_empty() {
        return None;
    }

    args.sort();

    let mid = args.len() / 2;
    if args.len() % 2 == 0 {
        Some((args[mid] + args[mid - 1]) as f64 / 2.0)
    } else {
        Some(args[mid] as f64)
    }
}
```

Once defined, a UDAF can be used within a SQL query like the built-in aggregate
functions:

```sql
SELECT my_median(bid.price), bid.auction, session(interval '10 second') as session
FROM nexmark
GROUP BY 2,3
```

## Nullability

If a UDAF argument type is an `Option` (e.g., `Vec<Option<i64>>`), the UDAF will
be invoked with all inputs, including `NULL`s. Otherwise, only non-null
arguments will be passed down to the UDAF. Unlike UDFs, UDAFs will always be
invoked, although possibly with empty input vectors.

## Debugging

If a UDAF encounters a panic while, diagnostic information is logged to the worker logs.
Note that these logs are not currently accessible via the Web UI.
If the UDAF fails to compile this will show up in the compilation service.
