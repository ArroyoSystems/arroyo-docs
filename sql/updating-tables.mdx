title: Updating Tables
description: 'Semantics for updating tables in Arroyo SQL'
---

In addition to handling real-time data using windows and watermarks, 
Arroyo SQL also supports updating tables. This is done by splitting rows into _inserts_ and _deletes_.
Inserts are new rows that have been added to the table, while deletes are rows that have been removed.

#### Reading from updating sources
Source connectors such as [kafka](/connectors/kafka) can specify the format as `'debezium_json'` to read [Debezium](https://debezium.io/)
formatted messages. Messages with an op value of `'c'` (create) and `'r'` (read) are treated as an insert,
an op value of `'d'` (delete) is treated as a delete, 
and an op value of `'u'` (update) is unrolled as a delete followed by an insert.

#### Manipulating updating data in SQL
Updating data can be `SELECT`ed over and filtered, however, it cannot be joined or aggregated.

#### Writing to updating sinks
Debezium data can be written to sinks with the `debezium_json` format. 
This will convert inserts into a `'c'` (create) operation, deletes into a `'d'` (delete) operation.

#### Non-windowed aggregates
Aggregating data without a window will result in an updating output. 
This will emit an insert the first time data is processed for a group and subsequent data 
will retract the prior value and then insert the new value.
Aggregates are buffered in the operator, occasionally flushing. By default flushing happens every 1 second,
but can be overridden with the UPDATE_AGGREGATE_FLUSH_MS environment variable.

For instance, the following query
```
CREATE TABLE impulse WITH (
    'connector' = 'impulse',
    event_rate = '100'
);
SELECT count(*) as rows
FROM impulse;
```
will produce output data like the following:

|before | after | op |
|-------|-------|----|
|null |` { "rows": 300}`| `"c"`|
|`{ "rows": 200 }`| null | `"d"`|
|null |	`{ "rows": 200 }`|	`"c"`|
|`{ "rows": 100 }`| null | `"d"`|
|null |`{ "rows": 100 }`| `"c"`|
