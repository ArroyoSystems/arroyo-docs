description: 'Querying data in Arroyo SQL'

Select statements are used to manipulate data in Arroyo.```
The general form of that statement is:
    
```sql
[WITH with_query [, ...]]
SELECT select_expr [, ...]
FROM from_item
[JOIN join_item [, ...]]
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY grouping_element [, ...]]
```

### WITH clause
The with clauses allow you to give names to subquery which you can then reference.
The syntax for a with clause is:

```sql
WITH query_name AS (subquery) [,...]
```
For example, using the nexmark source, you can create datasets for bids and price and then join.
```sql

WITH bids as 
(SELECT bid.auction as auction, bid.price as price 
FROM nexmark where bid is not null),
auctions as
(SELECT auction.id as id
FROM nexmark where auction is not null)
SELECT * FROM bids bids join auctions auctions on bids.auction = auctions.id;
```

### SELECT clause
The select cause is a comma-separated list of expressions, with an optional alias.
Because of DataFusion limitations, column names must be unique.

```sql
SELECT select_expr [, ...]
```

### FROM clause
The `FROM` clause specifies the primary source of data. 
It will be either a table name or subquery. 
The table name can be either a saved source,
 a table created in the `WITH` clause or a table created via `CREATE TABLE` and inserted into.
Tables can be given aliases, but will default to their name as the alias for things like joins.
```sql
FROM from_item
```

### JOIN clause
The `JOIN` clause allows you to join multiple tables together. 
By default it will be an inner join, but you can also specify `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or `FULL` joins.
Joins must include an `ON` clause specifying the join condition.
```sql 
SELECT * FROM bids join auctions on bids.auction = auctions.id;
```

### WHERE clause
The `WHERE` clause allows you to filter the data with a boolean condition.
This predicate is applied to the incoming rows, so cannot include conditions on the resulting columns.
```sql
WHERE condition
```

### GROUP BY clause
The `GROUP BY` clause is used to compute aggregates over some set of fields.
All GROUP BY queries will implicitly include a time window,
and if the input doesn't already have a time window, 
it should be specified as one of the grouping fields.

For example,

```sql
SELECT 
    count(*) as bids,
    count(distinct auction_id) as distinct_auctions,
    tumble(interval '1 minute') as window
    FROM BIDS GROUP BY 3
