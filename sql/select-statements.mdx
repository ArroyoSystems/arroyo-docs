title: SELECT Statements
description: 'Querying data in Arroyo SQL'

Select statements are used to manipulate data in Arroyo.
The general form of that statement is:

```sql
[WITH with_query [, ...]]
SELECT select_expr [, ...]
FROM from_item
[JOIN join_item [, ...]]
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY grouping_element [, ...]]
[HAVING condition]
```

### WITH clause
The with clauses allow you to give names to subquery which you can then reference.
The syntax for a with clause is:

```sql
WITH query_name AS (subquery) [,...]
```

For example, using the nexmark source, you can create datasets for bids and price and then join.

```sql

WITH bids AS
    (SELECT bid.auction AS auction, bid.price AS price
        FROM nexmark where bid is not null),
auctions AS
    (SELECT auction.id AS id
        FROM nexmark where auction is not null)
SELECT * FROM bids bids
        JOIN auctions auctions
            ON bids.auction = auctions.id;
```

### SELECT clause
The select cause is a comma-separated list of expressions, with an optional alias.

Column names must be unique.

```sql
SELECT select_expr [, ...]
```

### FROM clause
The `FROM` clause specifies the primary source of data.
It will be either a table name or subquery.
The table name can be either a saved source,
 a table created in the `WITH` clause or a table created via `CREATE TABLE` and inserted into.
Tables can be given aliases, but will default to their name as the alias for things like joins.
```sql
FROM from_item
```

### JOIN clause
The `JOIN` clause allows you to join multiple tables together.

See the [join documentation](/sql/joins) for more details.

### WHERE clause

The `WHERE` clause allows you to filter the data with a boolean condition.
This predicate is applied to the incoming rows, so cannot include conditions on the resulting columns.
```sql
WHERE condition
```

### GROUP BY clause

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to compute aggregates over some set of fields.
All GROUP BY queries will implicitly include a time window,
and if the input doesn't already have a time window,
it should be specified as one of the grouping fields.

For example,

```sql
SELECT
    count(*) AS bids,
    count(distinct auction_id) AS distinct_auctions,
    tumble(interval '1 minute') AS window
FROM BIDS GROUP BY 3
```

### HAVING clause

The HAVING clause allows filtering on the result of aggregations (as opposed to WHERE,
which filters on the _inputs_ to the aggregation). For example:

```sql
SELECT user_id, count(*) as count
FROM events
WHERE event_type = 'pageview'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING count > 5;
```

This query counts pageview events by user, then returns those users with more than 5 pageviews.

### UNNEST operator

The `UNNEST` operator allows you to unnest arrays into multiple rows. This can be used
as a normal scalar function with the following restrictions:

* It may only appear in the `SELECT` clause
* Only one array may be unnested per select statement
For example,

```sql
SELECT
    UNNEST(make_array(1, 2, 3)) as x
FROM BIDS;
```

which will produce the following output:

```
+---+
| x |
+---+
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
+---+
```
