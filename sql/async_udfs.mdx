title: Asynchronous User-Defined Functions
description: 'Run Async UDFs'
---

Arroyo's UDFs can be asynchronous.
This is useful for UDFs that need to make network requests or perform other asynchronous operations,
and therefore should not block processing. Since asynchronous UDFs are executed in parallel,
we can maintain high throughput even with longer-running UDFs.

Note that async UDFs, like all Rust async functions,
should not block as this will prevent execution of other tasks and can stall execution of the pipeline.
Instead, they should use asynchronous libraries (calling `.await` instead of blocking) or make use of
[spawn_blocking](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/fn.spawn_blocking.html).

To define an asynchronous UDF, use the `async` keyword in the function definition.

## Options

Async UDFs have a few configuration options that can be defined in a special comment at the top of the UDF,
similar to dependencies, under a `[udfs]` header.

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `async_results_ordered` | `true` | Whether to return results in the order they were requested (ordered) or as they are available (unordered). |
| `async_max_concurrency` | `100` | The maximum number of concurrent executions of this UDF. |
| `async_timeout_seconds` | `10` | The maximum number of seconds to wait for a result before timing out. Arroyo currently retries if `async_results_ordered` is false, and panics if it is true. |


## Context

Async UDFs can optionally define a `Context` struct that will be passed to each execution of the UDF.
This can be used to store resources that should be shared across executions of the UDF.

The `Context` struct must implement a pre-defined trait, `arroyo_types::UdfContext`.
The trait is defined as follows:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait UdfContext: Sync {
    async fn init(&self) {}
    async fn close(&self) {}
}
```

In addition to the above trait, the `Context` struct must also define a `new` function (with no arguments).
The `new` and `init` functions will be called once when the job starts,
and the `close` function will be called once when the job ends.

If a `Context` is defined, a `context` variable of type `Arc<Context>` will be passed as the first argument to the UDF.

## Example

This example defines an async UDF that's used to fetch a user's name from a database.

```rust
/*
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tokio-postgres = "0.7"
async-trait = "0.1.68"

[udfs]
async_results_ordered = true
async_max_concurrency = 10
async_timeout_seconds = 5
*/

use tokio_postgres::{NoTls, Error, Client};
use async_trait::async_trait;
use std::sync::Arc;
use tokio::sync::RwLock;

pub struct Context {
    client: RwLock<Option<Client>>,
}

impl Context {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            client: RwLock::new(None),
        }
    }
}

#[async_trait]
impl arroyo_types::UdfContext for Context {
    async fn init(&self) {
        let conn_str = "host=localhost user=arroyo password=arroyo dbname=my_db";

        let (client, connection) = tokio_postgres::connect(conn_str, NoTls).await.unwrap();

        let mut c = self.client.write().await;
        *c = Some(client);

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            if let Err(e) = connection.await {
                println!("connection error: {}", e);
            }
        });
    }
}

pub async fn user_name_from_id(context: Arc<Context>, id: i64) -> String {
    let client = context.client.read().await;
    let rows = client
        .as_ref()
        .unwrap()
        .query("SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = $1", &[&id])
        .await
        .unwrap();

    return if let Some(row) = rows.get(0) {
        row.get(0)
    } else {
        format!("Unknown-{}", id)
    };
}
```
