title: Aggregate Functions
description: 'Supported Aggregate Functions in Arroyo SQL'

Arroyo supports the following aggregate functions. 
All of them except count distinct are implemented in two phases, 
which helps minimize the state requirements and scale out aggregations.
Nullity is handled in line with postgres: 
`COUNT` always returns the number of non-null entries,
 all others ignore null arguments and return null if all arguments are null.

<Accordion title="count">
Returns the number of non-null entries in the group. 
Return type is always `BIGINT`. If `distinct` is specified will be number of unique non-null arguments.
```
-- number of records
count(*)
-- number of present ids
count(id)
-- number of distinct ids
count(distinct id)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="sum">
Returns the sum of numeric arguments. 32 bit numeric types will be promoted to 64 bit, 
e.g. `INT` to `BIGINT`, `FLOAT` to `DOUBLE`.
```sql
sum(price * quantity)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="avg">
Returns the average of non-null arguments. Result is always a `DOUBLE`.

```sql
avg(price)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="min">
Returns the minimum of non-null arguments. Result type is the same as the argument type.

```sql
min(price)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="max">
Returns the maximum of non-null arguments. Result type is the same as the argument type.

```sql
max(price)
```
</Accordion>
