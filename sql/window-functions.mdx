_Arroyo's window function implementations are based on
[Apache DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) and these docs are
derived from the DataFusion function reference._

A _window function_ performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are
somehow related to the current row. This is comparable to the type of
calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. However, window
functions do not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row like
non-window aggregate calls would. Instead, the rows retain their separate
identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than
just the current row of the query result.

For example, to calculate the most common auction in a dataset over the last 10 minutes every second,
you could use the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT ROW_NUMBER()  OVER (
        PARTITION BY window
        ORDER BY count DESC) as row_number, auction, count
    FROM (
      SELECT auction,
             hop(INTERVAL '1' second, INTERVAL '10' minute) as window,
             count(*) as count
        FROM bids
        GROUP BY 1, 2)) where row_number = 1;
```

Note that this is a distinct feature from Arroyo's
[streaming windows](/sql/windows), like `hop` and `slide`. Streaming windows
allow aggregating over records with a time bound, while SQL window functions
allow you to reference other rows without aggregating.

A window function call always contains an OVER clause directly following the
window function's name and argument(s). This is what syntactically distinguishes
it from a normal function or non-window aggregate. The OVER clause determines
exactly how the rows of the query are split up for processing by the window
function. The PARTITION BY clause within OVER divides the rows into groups, or
partitions, that share the same values of the PARTITION BY expression(s). For
each row, the window function is computed across the rows that fall into the
same partition as the current row. The previous example showed how to count the
average of a column per partition.

You can also control the order in which rows are processed by window functions
using ORDER BY within OVER. (The window ORDER BY does not even have to match the
order in which the rows are output.)

Note that currently window functions must contain a streaming window in the
PARTITION BY.

## Syntax

The syntax for the OVER-clause is

```
function([expr])
  OVER(
    [PARTITION BY expr[, …]]
    [ORDER BY expr [ ASC | DESC ][, …]]
    )
```

## Aggregate functions

All [aggregate functions](/sql/aggregate-functions) can be used as window functions.

## Ranking functions

### `row_number`

Number of the current row within its partition, counting from 1.

```sql
row_number()
```

### `rank`

Rank of the current row with gaps; same as row_number of its first peer.

```sql
rank()
```

### `dense_rank`

Rank of the current row without gaps; this function counts peer groups.

```sql
dense_rank()
```

### `ntile`

Integer ranging from 1 to the argument value, dividing the partition as equally as possible.

```sql
ntile(expression)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression**: An integer describing the number groups the partition should be split into

## Analytical functions

### `cume_dist`

Relative rank of the current row: (number of rows preceding or peer with current row) / (total rows).

```sql
cume_dist()
```

### `percent_rank`

Relative rank of the current row: (rank - 1) / (total rows - 1).

```sql
percent_rank()
```

### `lag`

Returns value evaluated at the row that is offset rows before the current row within the partition; if there is no such row, instead return default (which must be of the same type as value). Both offset and default are evaluated with respect to the current row. If omitted, offset defaults to 1 and default to null.

```sql
lag(expression, offset, default)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression**: Expression to operate on
- **offset**: Integer. Specifies how many rows back the value of _expression_ should be retrieved. Defaults to 1.
- **default**: The default value if the offset is not within the partition. Must be of the same type as _expression_.

### `lead`

Returns value evaluated at the row that is offset rows after the current row within the partition; if there is no such row, instead return default (which must be of the same type as value). Both offset and default are evaluated with respect to the current row. If omitted, offset defaults to 1 and default to null.

```sql
lead(expression, offset, default)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression**: Expression to operate on
- **offset**: Integer. Specifies how many rows forward the value of _expression_ should be retrieved. Defaults to 1.
- **default**: The default value if the offset is not within the partition. Must be of the same type as _expression_.

### `first_value`

Returns value evaluated at the row that is the first row of the window frame.

```sql
first_value(expression)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression**: Expression to operate on

### `last_value`

Returns value evaluated at the row that is the last row of the window frame.

```sql
last_value(expression)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression**: Expression to operate on

### `nth_value`

Returns value evaluated at the row that is the nth row of the window frame (counting from 1); null if no such row.

```sql
nth_value(expression, n)
```

**Arguments**

- **expression**: The name the column of which nth value to retrieve
- **n**: Integer. Specifies the _n_ in nth
