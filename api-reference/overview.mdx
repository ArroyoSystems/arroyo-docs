Arroyo exposes a gRPC API that can be used to create connections, sources,
sinks, pipelines and manage jobs.

The API proto file can be found here:
https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/blob/master/arroyo-rpc/proto/api.proto.

More complete API documentation with usage examples is coming. If you're looking to
get started with the API, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/cjCr5rVmyR)
or at support@arroyo.systems.
