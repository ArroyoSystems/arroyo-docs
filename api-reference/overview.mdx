In Arroyo 0.4, we've released the initial endpoints of REST API, supporting
creating and managing pipelines and jobs. The REST API by default runs at
http://localhost:8000/api.

More endpoints are coming. If you're looking to get started with the API, please
reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/cjCr5rVmyR) or at
support@arroyo.systems.

## Pagination

List resources return paginated responses wrapped in a JSON object that looks
like this:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "pl_asVfUS2zAa",
            ...
        },
        {
            "id": "pl_O6GKZiL6mn",
            ...
        },
        ...
    ],
    "hasMore": true
}
```

The `data` field contains the list of resources.
Currently the API does not yet support pagination,
so `hasMore` will always be false.
A future release will support a `startingAfter` query parameter
to fetch subsequent pages.
