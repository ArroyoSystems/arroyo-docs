As of Arroyo 0.6,
all functionality of Arroyo is available through the REST API.
The REST API by default runs at http://localhost:5115/api.

## Pagination

Some endpoints return collections that implement cursor-based pagination.
These API endpoints accept the query parameters `limit` and `startingAfter`,
and their responses include the `hasMore` field, for example:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "pl_asVfUS2zAa",
            ...
        },
        {
            "id": "pl_O6GKZiL6mn",
            ...
        },
        ...
    ],
    "hasMore": true
}
```

The `data` field contains the list of resources,
and the `hasMore` field indicates whether there are more items available.

The response represents a single page of results in reverse chronological order.
If `startingAfter` is not specified, the first page of results is returned.
You can set `startingAfter` to the `id` of the last item to retrieve the next page of results.

To see which endpoints support pagination,
check the OpenAPI specification at `/api/v1/api-docs/openapi.json`.
