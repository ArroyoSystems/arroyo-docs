In Arroyo 0.4, we've released the initial endpoints of REST API, supporting
creating and managing pipelines and jobs. The REST API by default runs at
http://localhost:8000/api.

More endpoints are coming. If you're looking to get started with the API, please
reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/cjCr5rVmyR) or at
support@arroyo.systems.

## Pagination

List resources return paginated responses wrapped in a JSON object that looks
like this:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "pl_asVfUS2zAa",
            ...
        },
        {
            "id": "pl_O6GKZiL6mn",
            ...
        },
        ...
    ],
    "hasMore": true
}
```

The `data` field contains the list of resources. The `hasMore` field indicates
whether there are more resources to fetch. If `hasMore` is `true`, you can
fetch the next page of resources by passing the `startingAfter` query parameter to
the endpoint, with the ID of the last resource in the `data` field.
