# v0.2.0

This release marks our first versioned release of Arroyo since we open-sourced the engine in April.

We're excited to welcome three new contributors to the project:

- [@rtyler](https://github.com/rtyler) made their first contribution in
  [#8](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/8)
- [@akennedy4155](https://github.com/akennedy4155) made their first contribution in
  [#49](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/49)
- [@jbeisen](https://github.com/jbeisen) made their first contribution in
  [#77](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/77)

With the 0.2.0 release, we are continuing to push forward on features, stability, and productionization. We've added
native Kubernetes support and easy deployment via a [Helm chart](https://doc.arroyo.dev/deployment/kubernetes), expanded
our SQL support with features like JSON functions and windowless joins, and made many more fixes and improvements
detailed below.

## Features

### Native Kubernetes support

As of release 0.2.0, Arroyo can natively target Kubernetes as a scheduler for running pipelines. We now also support
easily running the Arroyo control plane on Kubernetes using our new [helm
chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/arroyo/arroyo).

See the [docs](https://doc.arroyo.dev/deployment/kubernetes) for all the details.

- Add Kubernetes scheduler by [@mwylde](https://github.com/mwylde) in
  [#79](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/79)
- K8s deployment and helm chart by [@mwylde](https://github.com/mwylde) in
  [#91](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/91)

### Nomad deployments

Arroyo has long had first-class support for Nomad as a scheduler, where we take advantage of the very low-latency and
lightweight scheduling support. Now we also support Nomad as an easy deploy target for the control plane as well via a
[nomad pack](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo-nomad-pack).

See the docs [for more details](https://doc.arroyo.dev/deployment/nomad).

- Support for deploying Arroyo to a nomad cluster by [@mwylde](https://github.com/mwylde) in
  [#50](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/50)

### SQL features

With this release we are making big improvements in SQL completeness. Notably, we've made our JSON support much more
flexible with the introduction of SQL JSON functions including `get_json_objects`, `get_first_json_object`, and
`extract_json_string`.

We've also added support for windowless joins.
