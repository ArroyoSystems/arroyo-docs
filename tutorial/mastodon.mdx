[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) is a federated social network, similar to a distributed
twitter. Conveniently, it provides a public firehose of all posts, which will let us see how
Arroyo can be used in a real-world setting.

In this tutorial we are going to build a simple dashboard that shows the most popular hashtags
across the mastodon network.

Before starting this tutorial, you will need a running Arroyo cluster. See the [getting started](/getting-started)
guide to get that set up.

## Creating the connection

The first thing we need to do is create a source that will read from the Mastodon firehose. We
will be using the EventSource API (also known as Server-Sent Events) to read from the firehose, via
[this api](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/streaming/#public).

Arroyo has native support for EventSource, so we just need to configure it.

We will start by creating a _connection_, which tells Arroyo how to connect to a remote system (in this
case, an HTTP server).

Navigate to the connections tab (http://localhost:8000/connections), and click "Create Connection."

Select Http as the connect type, and enter the following configuration:

|  |  |
| ---- | ------- |
| Name | `mstdn` |
| URL | `https://mstdn.social/api` |

Leave the headers field blank (if we were connecting to a server that required authentication, we would
add it there).

Click `Test` to validate that we're able to connect to the server, then `Create`.

## Drinking from the firehose

We could create a reusable mastodon source in the Sources tab, but for now we'll create the source
directly in SQL.

Navigate to the Jobs tab (http://localhost:8000/jobs), and click `Create Pipeline`.

We'll start by just streaming in the data, to get a sense of what it looks like.

First, enter this SQL to define the mastodon source:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mastodon (
    id TEXT,
    uri TEXT,
    content TEXT
)
WITH (
    connection = 'mstdn',
    path = '/v1/streaming/public',
    events = 'update',
    serialization_mode = 'json');
```

Then follow that with a query over it:

```sql
select * from mastodon;
```

Click `Preview` to run a preview pipeline over the data.

<Tip>
    Arroyo has several ways to define sources and sinks. We can create a re-usable source in the Sources tab,
    which can be used in multiple pipelines. We can also define a source directly in SQL with a schema, as we
    did here. Finally, we could use the `rawJson` serialization mode to define a source without a schema, then
    use the JSON functions to parse the data.
</Tip>

You should see something like this:

## Extracting Hashtags

Next we need to extract the hashtags from the content. Conveniently, the mastodon API already extracts
hash tags for us like this:

```json
{
  ...
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "arroyostreaming",
      "url": "https://mstdn.social/tags/arroyostreaming"
    }
  ],
}
```

To access the tags, we'll need to define our source slightly differently, using the raw json encoder. This
will give us a single column called `value` with the raw JSON data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE mastodon (
    value TEXT
)
WITH (
    connection = 'mstdn',
    path = '/streaming/public',
    events = 'update',
    serialization_mode = 'raw_json');
```

Now we can pull out the tags using the `extract_json_string` function:

```sql
SELECT tag FROM (
    SELECT extract_json_string(value, '$.tags[*].name') AS tag
    FROM mastodon)
    WHERE tag IS NOT NULL;
```


The `extract_json_string` function, when applied to an array like `tags` will return the first value as a string. In
the future Arroyo will support an unnest function that will allow creating multiple rows from a single row, but for
now we'll just consider the first hashtag.

## Counting Hashtags

The next step is to find the count of each hashtag over a window of time.  We'll use a sliding window
that's 15 minutes wide (in other words, that looks back that far in the data stream) with a 5 second slide
(in other words, that updates every 5 seconds). In SQL, we can introduce a sliding window with the `hop`
function.

We'll also turn our tag query into a view to make it easier to work with:

```sql
CREATE VIEW tags AS (
    SELECT tag FROM (
        SELECT extract_json_string(value, '$.tags[*].name') AS tag
        FROM mastodon)
    WHERE tag is not null
);

SELECT tag, count(*) AS count
FROM tags
GROUP BY tag, hop(interval '5 seconds', interval '15 minutes');
```

## Finding the top tags

Finally, we can find the top tags by using a SQL window function to rank the tags by count:

<Tip>
    SQL window functions are not the same as Arroyo windows. SQL window functions are a way to
    perform calculations over multiple rows of data. Arroyo windows meanwhile aggregate over time.
    See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function_(SQL)) for more on SQL window functions.
</Tip>

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY window
        ORDER BY count DESC) as row_num
    FROM (SELECT count(*) as count,
        tag,
        hop(interval '5 seconds', interval '15 minutes') as window
            FROM tags
            group by tag, window)) WHERE row_num <= 5
```

This produces the the top 5 tags over the last 15 minutes by filtering on the `row_num` column, which
contains that tag's rank within the window.

<Tip>
    Arroyo is able to perform sophisticated optimizations over SQL queries like this. See this
    [blog post](https://www.arroyo.dev/blog/how-arroyo-beats-flink-at-sliding-windows) for some
    of the technical details.

## Visualizing the results

Now that we have our complete query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mastodon (
    value TEXT
)
WITH (
    connection = 'mastodon',
    path = '/streaming/public',
    events = 'update',
    serialization_mode = 'raw_json');


CREATE VIEW tags AS (
    SELECT tag FROM (
        SELECT extract_json_string(value, '$.tags[*].name') AS tag
     FROM mastodon)
    WHERE tag is not null
);

SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY window
        ORDER BY count DESC) as row_num
    FROM (SELECT count(*) as count,
        tag,
        hop(interval '5 seconds', interval '15 minutes') as window
            FROM tags
            group by tag, window)) WHERE row_num <= 5;
```

We can run the pipeline for real by clicking `Run`. Configure it with a web sink, which will
let us stream the results to a web browser.
