[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) is a federated social network, similar to a distributed
twitter. Conveniently, it provides a public firehose of all posts, which will let us see how
Arroyo can be used in a real-world setting.

In this tutorial we are going to build a simple dashboard that shows the most popular hashtags
across the mastodon network.

Before starting this tutorial, you will need a running Arroyo cluster. See the
[getting started](/getting-started) guide to get that set up.

## Creating the connection

The first thing we need to do is create a source that will read from the Mastodon firehose. We
will be using the Server-Sent Events API (also known as EventSource) to read from the firehose, via
[this api](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/streaming/#public).

Arroyo comes with an SSE connector, so we just need create a connection
that points to the mastodon API. Connections in Arroyo allow queries to
read and write data from external sources.

There are two ways to create a connection. We can create a re-usable connection in the
Connections tab, or we can create a connection directly in SQL. For this tutorial, we'll create
the connection directly in SQL.

Navigate to the Jobs tab (http://localhost:8000/jobs), and click `Create Pipeline`.

Connection tables are created via `CREATE TABLE` statements that have a
`connector` with option, which specifices which connector should be used; in
this case `sse` (for server-sent events). Also required is `format`, which
specifies the format of the data (in this case, `json`).

Then, each connector will have a set of options that may be set—for SSE, we need
to set the `endpoint` option to tell it where to connect to. We're also setting
the `events` field to filter the events that we will read. You can find all of the
options for the SSE connector in the [connectors docs](/connectors/server-sent-events).

We can define the mastodon source connection like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mastodon (
    id TEXT,
    uri TEXT,
    content TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'sse',
    format = 'json',
    endpoint = 'https://mstdn.social/api/v1/streaming/public',
    events = 'update'
);
```

Then we can read from it, to get a sense of the data:

```sql
select * from mastodon;
```

Click `Start Preview` to run a preview pipeline over the data.

You should see something like this:

## Extracting Hashtags

Next we need to extract the hashtags from the content. Conveniently, the mastodon API already extracts
hash tags for us like this:

```json
{
  ...
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "arroyostreaming",
      "url": "https://mstdn.social/tags/arroyostreaming"
    }
  ],
}
```

To access the tags, we'll need to define our source slightly differently, using the raw string format. This
will give us a single column called `value` with the raw JSON data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE mastodon (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'sse',
    format = 'raw_string',
    endpoint = 'https://mstdn.social/api/v1/streaming/public',
    events = 'update'
);
```

Now we can pull out the tags using the `extract_json_string` function:

```sql
SELECT tag FROM (
    SELECT extract_json_string(value, '$.tags[*].name') AS tag
    FROM mastodon)
    WHERE tag IS NOT NULL;
```


The `extract_json_string` function, when applied to an array like `tags` will return the first value as a string. In
the future Arroyo will support an unnest function that will allow creating multiple rows from a single row, but for
now we'll just consider the first hashtag.

## Counting Hashtags

The next step is to find the count of each hashtag over a window of time.  We'll use a sliding window
that's 15 minutes wide (in other words, that looks back that far in the data stream) with a 5 second slide
(in other words, that updates every 5 seconds). In SQL, we can introduce a sliding window with the `hop`
function.

We'll also turn our tag query into a view to make it easier to work with:

```sql
CREATE VIEW tags AS (
    SELECT tag FROM (
        SELECT extract_json_string(value, '$.tags[*].name') AS tag
        FROM mastodon)
    WHERE tag is not null
);

SELECT tag, count(*) AS count
FROM tags
GROUP BY tag, hop(interval '5 seconds', interval '15 minutes');
```

## Finding the top tags

Finally, we can find the top tags by using a SQL window function to rank the tags by count:

<Tip>
    SQL window functions are not the same as Arroyo windows. SQL window functions are a way to
    perform calculations over multiple rows of data, while Arroyo windows aggregate over time.

    See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function_(SQL)) for more on SQL window functions.
</Tip>

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY window
        ORDER BY count DESC) as row_num
    FROM (SELECT count(*) as count,
        tag,
        hop(interval '5 seconds', interval '15 minutes') as window
            FROM tags
            group by tag, window)) WHERE row_num <= 5
```

This produces the the top 5 tags over the last 15 minutes by filtering on the `row_num` column, which
contains that tag's rank within the window.

<Tip>
    Arroyo is able to perform sophisticated optimizations over SQL queries like this. See this
    [blog post](https://www.arroyo.dev/blog/how-arroyo-beats-flink-at-sliding-windows) for some
    of the technical details.

## Visualizing the results

Now that we have our complete query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mastodon (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'sse',
    format = 'raw_string',
    endpoint = 'https://mstdn.social/api/v1/streaming/public',
    events = 'update'
);

CREATE VIEW tags AS (
    SELECT tag FROM (
        SELECT extract_json_string(value, '$.tags[*].name') AS tag
     FROM mastodon)
    WHERE tag is not null
);

SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY window
        ORDER BY count DESC) as row_num
    FROM (SELECT count(*) as count,
        tag,
        hop(interval '5 seconds', interval '15 minutes') as window
            FROM tags
            group by tag, window)) WHERE row_num <= 5;
```

We can run the pipeline for real by clicking `Start Pipeline`. Give it a name,
then click `Start` to run the pipeline.
