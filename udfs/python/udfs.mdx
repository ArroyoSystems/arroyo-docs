title: Python UDFs
description: Write UDFs in Python
---

Arroyo user-defined functions (UDFs) can be written in Python. UDFs are defined
as Python functions, and registered with Arroyo using the `@udf` decorator.

Python UDFs are available in Arroyo 0.12.0 and later. Currently only scalar UDFs
are supported in Python, although support for UDAFs and async UDFs is planned for
future releases.

Here's an example of a simple UDF that squares an integer:

```python
from arroyo_udf import udf

@udf
def format_line(x: int, y: float) -> str:
    return f"{x} {y:.2f}"
```

For more general details about UDFs, see the [UDF overview](/udfs/overview).

## UDF signature

The signature of the UDF (the function name, parameters, and return type) is
determined automatically from the definition of the function annotated with
`@udf`. The function must be a valid Python function, and the parameters and
return type must be Python types that have a SQL mapping. For the full list of
supported types, see the [SQL data types](/sql/data-types).

In order to determine the types of the UDF parameters and return value, Arroyo
expects Python [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).

Note that because Python does not have as many numeric types as SQL,
multiple SQL types may map to the same Python type. For example, `INT` and
`BIGINT` both map to `int`, and `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` both map to `float`.

## Nullability

SQL values are generally allowed to be null. How null values interact with your
UDF is controlled via the type signature of the UDF parameters and return types.
If a parameter is an `Optional` type (for example `Optional[int]`), then it will
be called with all inputs, even if they are `NULL`. If the parameter is not an
`Optional` type (for example `int`), then it will only be called with non-`NULL`
inputs.

Similarly, if the return type is an `Optional` type, then the output type is
nullable, otherwise it is non-nullable.

In table form:

| Input    | Parameter type | Return type | Called on       | Nullability |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Nullable | `T`            | `T`         | Non-null values | Nullable    |
| Nullable | `Optional[T]`  | `T`         | All values      | Non-null    |
| Nullable | `T`            | `Optional[T]` | Non-null values | Nullable    |
| Nullable | `Optional[T]`  | `Optional[T]` | All values      | Nullable    |
| Non-null | `T`            | `T`         | All values      | Non-null    |
| Non-null | `Optional[T]`  | `T`         | All values      | Non-null    |
| Non-null | `T`            | `Optional[T]` | All values      | Nullable    |
| Non-null | `Optional[T]`  | `Optional[T]` | All values      | Nullable    |

Note that the `Optional` type is from the Python `typing` module and must be
imported to use, like this:

```python
from typing import Optional

@udf
def supply_default(x: Optional[int]) -> int:
    if x is None:
        return None
    return x * x
```

## Python Environment

Arroyo will use the Python environment that is available on the system where the
Arroyo controller and workers are running. This may be system Python or a
virtualenv. If using a virtualenv, activate it before starting the Arroyo
cluster.

If running Arroyo via the official Docker image, the Python environment is
already provided by the image.

### Minimum Python version

In order to enable high levels of scalability when running multiple Python UDFs
across parallel subtasks, Arroyo relies on the new _sub-interpreter_ feature in
Python 3.12. As a result, earlier versions of Python are not supported.

### Dependencies

Arroyo currently does not support installing dependencies dynamically for Python
UDFs. If your UDF requires additional Python packages, you must install them
manually in the Python environment where Arroyo is running. This is easiest
done by using a virtualenv.
