title: Rust UDAFs
description: User-defined aggregate functions
---

Arroyo SQL supports User-Defined Aggregate Functions, allowing you to extend the
system's capabilities with custom aggregation logic written in Rust. UDAFs are
deployed and managed in the same way as scalar UDFs; see the [UDF
docs](/udfs/overview) for details.

Currently UDAFs are only supported in Rust.

## Defining a UDAF

UDAFs are defined as functions that take some number of `Vec<T>` as an
argument, where `T` is any valid [SQL data type](/sql/data-types). Note
that all arguments must be `Vec`â€”you can't mix-and-match vector and scalar
parameters.

### Example

Here's a simple UDAF for calculating the median of a set of integers:

```rust
use arroyo_sql_plugin::udf;

#[udf]
fn my_median(mut args: Vec<i64>) -> Option<f64> {
    if args.is_empty() {
        return None;
    }

    args.sort();

    let mid = args.len() / 2;
    if args.len() % 2 == 0 {
        Some((args[mid] + args[mid - 1]) as f64 / 2.0)
    } else {
        Some(args[mid] as f64)
    }
}
```

Once defined, a UDAF can be used within a SQL query like the built-in aggregate
functions:

```sql
SELECT
    my_median(bid.price),
    bid.auction,
    SESSION(interval '10 second') as session
FROM nexmark
GROUP BY 2,3
```

## Nullability

If a UDAF argument type is an `Option` (e.g., `Vec<Option<i64>>`), the UDAF will
be invoked with all inputs, including `NULL`s. Otherwise, only non-null
arguments will be passed down to the UDAF. Unlike UDFs, UDAFs will always be
invoked, although possibly with empty input vectors.
