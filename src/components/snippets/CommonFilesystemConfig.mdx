### File rollover configs

These configs control when files are rolled over, creating new files. Rolling over
more frequently allows lower latency for readers, but at the cost of more files, which
can slow down queries.

| Field | Description | Default | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| `rolling_policy.file_size` | Target size in a file before it is rolled | None | `'128MB'` |
| `rolling_policy.interval` | Amount of time a file after creation that a file will be rolled, expressed as a SQL interval | None | `interval '30 minutes'` |
| `rolling_policy.inactivity_interval` | Number of seconds a file will be open without any new data before it will be rolled | None | `interval '1 hour'` |


#### File Naming Options

By default Arroyo names files using [UUIDv7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_7_(timestamp_and_random)),
which ensures that they sort in time-order. This behavior can be configured via the following options:

| Field | Description | Default |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- |
| `filename.prefix` | Prefix that will be appended to the beginning of the file name, followed by a `-` | None |
| `filename.suffix` | Suffix (extension) that will be appended to the end of the file name, preceded by a `.` | `'json'` or  `'parquet'` |
| `filename.strategy` | Filenaming strategy to use. Supported values: `serial`, `uuid`, `ulid`, `uuid_v7` | `'uuid_v7'` |

### Parquet Options

| Field | Description | Default |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | 
| `parquet.compression` | The compression codec to use for Parquet files. Supported values: `none`, `snappy`, `gzip`, `zstd`, `lz4`, `lz4_raw`. | `'zstd'` |
| `parquet.row_group_size` | Target size for each Parquet row group | `'128MB'` |

### Multipart upload settings

Thes options allow configuring the behavior of how writes against object storage are split into parts:

| Field | Description | Default |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- |
| `multipart.target_part_size` | The target size of each multipart upload. Must be at least 5MB. | `'32MB'` |
| `multipart.max_parts` | Maximum number of multipart uploads before a multipart will be completed | `1000` |
