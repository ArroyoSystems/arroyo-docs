title: Delta Lake Sink
description: "Write Parquet files to a Delta Lake Table"
---

Data from Arroyo can be written to a Delta Lake table using the `delta` sink.
This sink shares most of its code with the [File System Sink](/connectors/filesystem),
and as such, it supports all of the same configuration options.

However, it has the following constraints:
* The `format` option must be set to `parquet`, as Delta Lake only supports Parquet files.
* Delta can only be used as a sink, not a source.
* Partitioning is not integrated with the delta log.

## Example query
```sql
CREATE TABLE delta_sink (
    id INTEGER,
    name STRING,
    age INTEGER
) WITH (
    'connector' = 'delta',
    'path' = 's3://my_bucket/my_table',
    'format' = 'parquet',
    'filename.strategy' = 'uuid'
);
INSERT INTO delta_sink SELECT id, name, age FROM my_source;
```

## Commit Behavior
Arroyo commits to Delta Lake tables using the same two-phase commit protocol as the File System Sink.
The files to be written are staged and then committed after taking a reliable checkpoint.
Idempotence is ensured by validating the table version before appending and, if different than expected,
checking all intervening versions to ensure that the data was not already added.
