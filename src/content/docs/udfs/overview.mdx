title: UDF Overview
description: Extending Arroyo with user-defined functions

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Arroyo SQL can be extended with user-defined functions, written in Rust or
Python.  The parameters and return type of the UDF are determined by the 
definition of the function and all types must be valid [SQL data types](/sql/data-types).

For String and Binary types (`TEXT` `BYTEA` in SQL), UDFs use the reference type
(`&str` and `&[u8]`) for arguments and the owned types (`String` and `Vec<u8>`)
for return values.

Arroyo UDFs are annotated with the `#[udf]` in the arroyo\_udf\_plugin crate if they
are written in rust and the `@udf` decorators if you use Python. UDFs can be defined
as part of the SQL API call, or via the Web UI.

Here's an example of a simple UDF that squares an integer:

<Tabs>
  ```python Python
  from arroyo_udf import udf

  @udf
  def my_square(x: int) -> int:
      return x * x
  ```

  ```rust Rust
  use arroyo_udf_plugin::udf;

  #[udf]
  fn my_square(x: u64) -> u64 {
    x * x
  }
  ```
</Tabs>

Once registered, this UDF can be used in SQL queries:

```sql
CREATE TABLE impulse with (
  connector = 'impulse',
  event_rate = '10'
);

SELECT my_square(counter)
FROM impulse;
```

For a complete example of how to use UDFs to solve a real-world problem of custom
format parsing, see the [UDF tutorial](/tutorial/udfs).

## Creating UDFs

UDFs are developed and managed in the Web UI, within the Pipeline editor. To create a new UDF,
navigate to the UDFs tab and click "New."

The name for the UDF is determined automatically from the function name that is
annotated with `#[udf]` for Rust or `@udf` for Python. You may include helper
functions, structs, and other definitions so long as only one function has the
udf annotation.

As you're developing, you may make use of the "Check" button to validate the UDF
definition. Any Rust compilation or Python parsing errors will be included in
the errors box at the bottom of the UI.

## Global UDFs

UDFs may be either *local*—associated with a particular pipeline—or *global*, in which case they are stored
in the database and may be used in any pipeline.

All UDFs begin as local. If you've written a UDF that will benefit from being globally available, you can
make it global by hovering over the tab containing the UDF, and clicking the "Globalize" button in the
drop down.

Global UDFs are available in all pipelines, but will be shadowed by local UDFs with the same name.

## Performance considerations

UDFs are expected to run and return quickly (think microseconds, not milliseconds). This means they
shouldn't do any blocking work (like making network requests) or CPU-intensive computations. Within
the Arroyo dataflow, UDFs are treated as normal scalar functions. They run serially against a batch of
data, and while they run forward progress is blocked.

If you need to use IO, CPU-intensive computations, or other usecases for long-running UDFs, see
[async UDFs](/udfs/rust/async-udfs).

## Debugging UDFs

If UDFs panic, they will produce log lines in the worker logs. These are not currently forwarded to the Web UI, so you
will need to find the logs where the workers are running. For the default `process` scheduler, this will be in the
controller logs. For the `kubernetes` scheduler, this will be within the actual worker pods.
