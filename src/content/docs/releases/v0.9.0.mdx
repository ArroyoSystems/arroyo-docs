*These release notes are also available on the [Arroyo blog](https://www.arroyo.dev/blog/arroyo-0-9-0).*

Arroyo 0.9.0 introduces async UDFs, which allow users to use databases,
services, and models from within their pipelines. It also brings support for
joining update tables, more control over bad data handling, a redesigned
connection profile editor, and more.

For this release, we are thrilled to welcome two new contributors to the Arroyo
project:

* [@tqwewe](https://github.com/tqwewe) made their first contribution in
  [#456](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/456)
* [@breezykermo](https://github.com/breezykermo) made their first contribution
  in [#476](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/476)

## Async UDFs

User-defined functions (UDFs) and user-defined aggregate functions (UDAFs) allow
you to extend Arroyo with custom logic. New in Arroyo 0.9 is support for what
we call _async UDFs_.

Existing (sync) UDFs are expected to implement simple, computational
logic. Common use cases include parsing custom formats, implementing functions
that are not natively supported, or implementing custom business logic that would
be difficult to express in SQL. Because they are run synchronously with processing,
if they take too long to run they can block the entire pipeline.

This isn't a hypothetical concern. A UDF that takes 10ms to run will be limited
to processing just 100 events per second per subtask!

And there are many use cases where you want to run logic that is not a simple,
stateless computation. You may need to do point lookups in a database to enrich
events, make an API call to another service, or even perform inference against
an AI model.

Async UDFs allow you to do all of these things, without blocking the pipeline.
Async UDFs are defined as a Rust `async fn`, supporting non-blocking IO. Then within
the Arroyo runtime, many instances of the UDF can be run in parallel, with a
configurable concurrency limit.

What does this look like? Let's take an example of a UDF that enriches web events
with GeoIP data by calling a GeoIP service. First, we define the UDF:

```rust
/*
[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.11.23", features = ["json"] }
serde_json = "1"

[udfs]
async_max_concurrency = 1000
*/

pub async fn get_city(ip: String) -> Option<String> {
  let body: serde_json::Value =
    reqwest::get(
      format!("http://geoip-service:8000/{ip}"))
        .await
        .ok()?
        .json()
        .await
        .ok()?;

    body.pointer("/names/en").and_then(|t|
      t.as_str()
    ).map(|t| t.to_string())
}
```

Then we can use this UDF in a query, for example this
one that finds the most common cities in the last 15 minutes:

```sql
create view cities as
select get_city(logs.ip) as city
from logs;

SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY window
        ORDER BY count DESC) as row_num
    FROM (SELECT count(*) as count,
        city,
        hop(interval '5 seconds', interval '15 minutes') as window
            FROM cities
            WHERE city IS NOT NULL
            group by city, window)) WHERE row_num <= 5;
```

Async UDFs support several configuration options that control their behavior,
including the maximum number of concurrent requests, timeouts, and whether event
order should be preserved.

They also support defining a _Context_ struct which is passed in to each invocation
of the UDF. This allows you to do setup for expensive operations (like setting up
a Database connection pool) just once, and share the result with all invocations.

For example, we can create a client for Postgres like this:

```rust
pub struct Context {
    client: RwLock<Option<Client>>,
}

impl Context {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            client: RwLock::new(None),
        }
    }
}

#[async_trait]
impl arroyo_types::UdfContext for Context {
    async fn init(&self) {
        let conn_str = "host=localhost user=dbuser password=dbpassword dbname=my_db";

        let (client, connection) = tokio_postgres::connect(conn_str, NoTls).await.unwrap();

        let mut c = self.client.write().await;
        *c = Some(client);

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            if let Err(e) = connection.await {
                println!("connection error: {}", e);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

See the [docs](https://doc.arroyo.dev/sql/async-udfs) for full details.

## Joining Update tables

Arroyo has [two semantics for streaming SQL](https://www.arroyo.dev/blog/what-is-streaming-sql),
one based on event-time watermarks and another that we call "Update Tables," which allow for
incremental computation of most analytical SQL constructs. However, previously there was a
restriction on joins, which were only supported for the watermark semantic.

Now that restriction is gone, and update tables can be joined. Hurray!

For example, this query will count the number of page views by user, and when a transaction
comes in joins that accumulated count:

```sql
CREATE VIEW page_view_counts as
SELECT count(*) as count, user_id as user_id
FROM page_views
GROUP BY user_id;


SELECT T.user_id, amount, P.count as page_views
FROM transactions T
LEFT JOIN page_view_counts P on T.user_id = P.user_id;
```

* Support joining updating data by [@jbeisen](https://github.com/jbeisen) in
  [#420](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/420)
* Just retract the final row of an outer join, rather than (None, None) by
  [@jacksonrnewhouse](https://github.com/jacksonrnewhouse) in
  [#490](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/490)


## Bad Data handling

It happens to the best of us. You've carefully built out your data architecture, perform
rigorous code reviews, and diligently monitor your rollouts.

And yet it happens—somehow, invalid data got into your Kafka topic. Now in Arroyo 0.9,
you can now configure the source to drop bad data instead of causing a processing failure.

This behavior can be configured via the Web UI or with the `bad_data` option when
creating a source in SQL. Two options are currently available:

* `fail` (default, and behavior in Arroyo 0.8) causes the pipeline to restart
  when bad data is encountered
* `drop` causes the data to be dropped, while logging an error message to the
  console and incrementing the `arroyo_worker_deserialization_errors` metric

* Add control for deserialization error behavior by [@jbeisen](https://github.com/jbeisen) in [#443](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/443)
* Add bad data option to create connection form by [@jbeisen](https://github.com/jbeisen) in [#452](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/452)

## Environment variable substitution

Some connectors need to be configured with authentication details or other secret data. Today in
Arroyo those secrets are stored in the configuration database (postgres), which is not very secure.

Now in Arroyo 0.9, we're introducing environment-variable substitution for sensitive configuration
fields:

This feature allows you to use double curly braces (`{{ }}`) to reference environment variables, which will
get substituted in at run time. For example, if you have an environment variable called `WEBHOOK_SECRET`
you can now include this as a header in a [webhook sink](https://doc.arroyo.dev/connectors/webhook) like

```
Authentication: Basic {{ WEBHOOK_SECRET }}
```

Env variable substitution can be used for both connections created via the Web UI and those created directly
in SQL, like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE slack (
    value TEXT
) WITH (
    connector = 'webhook',
    endpoint = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/{{ SLACK_KEY }}',
    method = 'POST',
    headers = 'Content-Type:application/json',
    format = 'json'
);
```

* Support environment variable substitution by [@jbeisen](https://github.com/jbeisen) in [#433](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/433)

## Confluent Cloud connector

[Confluent](https://confluent.io) is the company founded by the creators of Apache Kafka. They provide
a cloud-native distribution of Kafka and serverless Kafka platform. While Arroyo has always supported
reading and writing from Kafka, with Arroyo 0.9 we're making it even easier to integrate with your
Confluent Cloud topics with the new Confluent Cloud connector.

See the [complete integration guide](https://doc.arroyo.dev/connectors/confluent) to get started.

* Add Confluent connector by [@mwylde](https://github.com/mwylde) in [#448](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/448)

## Connection Profile UI

[Connection Profiles](https://doc.arroyo.dev/connectors/overview#connection-profiles) encapsulate
common configuration that is shared across multiple connection tables. For example, a single Kafka
cluster may have many topics that you would like to consumer or produce to from Arroyo.

We've upgraded the process of creating and managing these profiles. It's now possible to view and
delete existing connection profiles, and the whole UI has gotten a little spiffier.

We're also now validating that the profile is good (like ensuring we can talk to Kafka with
the provided address and credentials), so you don't discover you mistyped something at the
end of the connection creation process.

* Redesign cluster profile UI and add validation by [@mwylde](https://github.com/mwylde) in [#454](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/454)
* Add autocomplete when creating connections and Kafka topic autocomplete by [@mwylde](https://github.com/mwylde) in [#458](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/pull/458)
