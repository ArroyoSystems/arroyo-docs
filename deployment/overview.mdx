description: "Running a distributed Arroyo cluster"
---

While the single-node Arroyo cluster is useful for testing and development, it is not suitable for production. This
page describes how to run a production-ready distributed Arroyo cluster using either Arroyo's built-in scheduler or
[nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/).

Before attempting to run a cluster, you should familiarize yourself with the [Arroyo architecture](/architecture). We
are also happy to support users rolling out their own clusters, so please reach out to us at support@arroyo.systems or
on discord with any questions.

## Common Setup

### Postgres

Arroyo relies on a postgres database to store configuration data and metadata. You will need to create a database
(by default called `arroyo`, but this can be configured).

### S3

You will need to create a S3 bucket to store checkpoints and artifacts. This will need to be writable by the nodes
that are running the Arroyo controller and workers.

### Prometheus

The Arroyo Web UI can show job metrics to help monitor job progress. To enable this, you will need to set up a Prometheus
server. See the [prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) for more details.
