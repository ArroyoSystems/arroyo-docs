description: "Setting up an Arroyo cluster on VMs or bare-metal servers"
---

This document will cover how to run an Arroyo cluster on Linux VMs or bare-metal
server, like EC2 instances. This requires a good understanding of the Arroyo
architecture. For an easier approach to running a production-quality Arroyo
cluster, see the docs for running on top of [Kubernetes](/deployment/kubernetes).

Before starting this guide, follow the common setup steps in the [deployment overview](/deployment/overview) guide.

There are two options for running Arroyo on VMs; you may run the arroyo binary directly,
or use Docker.

Binaries for release versions are available for Linux (x86 and ARM) and MacOS (M1) on the
[Github Releases page](https://github.com/ArroyoSystems/arroyo/releases), or you can build your own binaries
by following the [dev guide](/developing/dev-setup).

<Tip>
If building your own binary, make sure to use the
`--release` flag when calling `cargo build`. You may also want to build on a machine with the same CPU
as you plan to deploy with and use the env var `RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native'` to get the best performance
at the cost of portability to CPUs with different micro-architectures.
</Tip>

Alternatively, you can run the arroyo docker image, `ghcr.io/arroyosystems/arroyo:latest`.

## Running the migrations

Arroyo supports [two databases for its configuration store](http://localhost:3001/architecture#config-database): Sqlite
(the default) and Postgres. The chosen database can be configured via the `database.type` config option or via
`ARROYO__DATABASE__TYPE` env var.

If you are using Postgres you will need to run the database migrations on your
database before starting the cluster.

By default, Arroyo will expect a database called `arroyo`, a user account `arroyo` with password `arroyo`
at `localhost:5432`. These can be configured via the [database config options](/configuration#database).

## Running the cluster

The Arroyo cluster can run in two modes on VMs; either as a single-node cluster using the _process_ scheduler,
or as a distributed cluster using the _node_ scheduler. The former is simpler, but cannot scale horizontally.

Additionally, you may decide to run all Arroyo services together in a single
process, or as a separate processes for high-availability. This guide will only
cover the former; for guidance on more complex deployments please reach out to
the dev team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/cjCr5rVmyR) or at
[support@arroyo.systems](mailto:support@arroyo.systems).

### Configuration

In addition to the database configs described in the migration section, there are several
other configuration options that you may wish to set via environment variables, including
[CHECKPOINT_URL and ARTIFACT_URL](/deployment/overview#storage). Note that for a distributed
cluster, those must be set to remote storage that is accessible by all nodes in the cluster.

### Arroyo services

The entire Arroyo control plane can be run as a single process with the _cluster_ subcommand:

<Card>
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Binary">
```bash
$ arroyo cluster
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Docker">
```bash
$ docker run ghcr.io/arroyosystems/arroyo:latest cluster
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Card>

For high-availability, this should be managed by a process manager like systemd.

### Schedulers

Arroyo ships with two [schedulers](/architecture#schedulers) that can be used for
VM deployments: `process` and `node`. The scheduler is selected via the `controller.scheduler`
config option or the `ARROYO__CONTROLLER__SCHEDULER` environment variable.

#### Process scheduler

The process scheduler is the default. It runs pipelines by spawning new processes on the same host
as the control plane. This is great for simple, single-node deployments as no other infrastructure
is required.

To use the process scheduler, run the control plane with `controller.scheduler=process` or with no
scheduler configuration.

#### Node scheduler

The node scheduler supports running a distributed Arroyo cluster without
requiring Kubernetes or another complex distributed runtime. An Arroyo node cluster is
made up on some number of hosts running the `node` process, which are able to schedule work,
and a control plane running with `controller.scheduler=node`.

A node can be run via the arroyo binary or Docker image:

<Card>
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Binary">
```bash
$ ARROYO__CONTROLLER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9190 arroyo node
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Docker">
```bash
$ docker run \
  -e ARROYO__CONTROLLER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9190 \
  ghcr.io/arroyosystems/arroyo:latest cluster
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Card>

Replace the `ARROYO__CONTROLLER_ENDPOINT` configuration with the host and port that the controller is running on.

Note that the node should always be run within a process manager that restarts
it, like systemd; nodes are designed to restart when they lose connection to the controller.

Nodes can be configured with a given number of _slots_, via the `node.tasks-slots`
config. This controls how many parallel subtasks can run on that node;
typically, you would want to set this to the number of CPUs but this can be somewhat
hardware and workload dependent.
