title: Pipeline clusters
description: "Pipeline clusters are a lightweight mode for running individual jobs"
---

Pipeline clusters provide a lightweight way to run a single pipeline in a self-contained
minicluster. They are a great choice for development, CI, and serverless platforms like
AWS Fargate, Google CloudRun, and Fly.io.

A pipeline cluster is created with the `arroyo run` subcommand:

```shellsession
$ arroyo run --help
Run a query as a local pipeline cluster

Usage: arroyo run [OPTIONS] [QUERY]

Arguments:
  [QUERY]  The query to run [default: -]

Options:
  -n, --name <NAME>                Name for this pipeline
  -s, --state-dir <STATE_DIR>      Directory or URL where checkpoints and metadata
                                   will be written and restored from
  -p, --parallelism <PARALLELISM>  Number of parallel subtasks to run [default: 1]
  -f, --force                      Force the pipeline to start even if the state
                                   file does not match the query
  -h, --help                       Print help
```

## Running a query

A pipeline cluster runs a single SQL query, however that query may contain
multiple independent `INSERT INTO...SELECT` statements.

The query can be specified in one of three ways:

1. Via STDIN:
```shellsession
$ echo "SELECT * FROM ..." | arroyo run
```
2. As a CLI argument:

```shellsession
$ arroyo run query.sql
```

3. As an environment variable:

```shellsession
$ ARROYO__RUN__QUERY="SELECT * FROM ..." arroyo run
```

## State

Arroyo is a stateful system, capable of consistently saving and restoring
in-progress computations. For Pipeline clusters, that state can be stored on a
local filesystem or on an object store. To learn more about the supported object
stores and how to configure them, see the
[storage docs](/deployment/overview#storage). For production deployments, it is
recommended to always use an object store.

The storage location is specified on the command line with the `--state-dir` argument,
or via an environment variable with `ARROYO__RUN__STATE_DIR`.

For example

```shellsession
$ run --state-dir s3://my-bucket/pipelines/my-pipeline query.sql
```

If this is the first time the pipeline has been run with this state directory, it will
start with a fresh state. On subsequent runs the existing state will be restored.

This directory is expected to be exclusive to a single pipeline; i.e., for every new
pipeline you want to run you should specify a different directory or object-store key.
Doing otherwise will produce an error, which can be overridden with the `--force` flag.
