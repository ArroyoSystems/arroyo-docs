description: "Setting up Arroyo locally"
---

Arroyo ships as a single, self-contained binary for Linux and MacoS or as a docker container. It can be run in two
modes: as a persistent multi-job _session cluster_, or a single-job _pipeline cluster_. When run locally or in Docker,
the default sqlite database is used to store configuration data.

## Starting a cluster

### Locally

The easiest way to try out Arroyo is to run it locally. Currently Linux and MacOS are well supported.

For MacOS, we provide a Homebrew tap that can be used to install Arroyo:

```shellsession
brew install arroyosystems/tap/arroyo
```

For MacOS and Linux, you can also install the binary with the following script:

```shellsession
curl -LsSf https://arroyo.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Alternatively, you can download the binary for your OS and architecture from the
[releases page](https://github.com/arroyosystems/arroyo/releases).

Once you've installed Arroyo, you can run it with the `arroyo` command:

```shellsession
$ arroyo --help
Usage: arroyo [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  run         Run a query as a local pipeline cluster
  api         Starts an Arroyo API server
  controller  Starts an Arroyo Controller
  cluster     Starts a complete Arroyo cluster
  worker      Starts an Arroyo worker
  compiler    Starts an Arroyo compiler server
  node        Starts an Arroyo node server
  migrate     Runs database migrations on the configured Postgres database
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -c, --config <CONFIG>          Path to an Arroyo config file, in TOML or YAML
                                 format
      --config-dir <CONFIG_DIR>  Directory in which to look for configuration files
  -h, --help                     Print help
  -V, --version                  Print version
```

A local cluster can be started with

```shellsession
$ arroyo cluster
2024-07-01T22:58:29.316336Z  INFO arroyo_server_common: Starting cluster admin server on 0.0.0.0:8119
2024-07-01T22:58:29.339237Z  INFO arroyo_api: Starting API server on 0.0.0.0:5115
2024-07-01T22:58:29.342200Z  INFO arroyo_controller: Using process scheduler
2024-07-01T22:58:29.348490Z  INFO arroyo_controller: Starting arroyo-controller on 0.0.0.0:5116
2024-07-01T22:58:29.364186Z  INFO arroyo_compiler_service: Starting compiler service at 0.0.0.0:5117
```

Then, open the Web UI in your browser at http://localhost:5115.

### With Docker

Arroyo can also run in Docker. Note that by default, a docker cluster will not persist the set of pipelines and tables.

```bash
$ docker run -p 5115:5115 ghcr.io/arroyosystems/arroyo:latest
```

<Tip>
    If you get an error like

    ```
    Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:5115:
    bind: address already in use.
    ```
    Then you have another service running on that port. Either stop that service, or rebind to a different port with
    `-p 5215:5115` for example.
</Tip>

Then, open the Web UI at http://localhost:5115.

## Running a single pipeline

In addition to the multi-tenant _session cluster_ mode, Arroyo can also be configured to run a single pipeline
via the CLI as a _pipeline cluster_ via the `arroyo run` subcommand:

```shellsession
$ arroyo run --help
Run a query as a local pipeline cluster

Usage: arroyo run [OPTIONS] [QUERY]

Arguments:
  [QUERY]  The query to run [default: -]

Options:
  -n, --name <NAME>                Name for this pipeline
  -s, --state-dir <STATE_DIR>      Directory or URL where checkpoints and metadata
                                   will be written and restored from
  -p, --parallelism <PARALLELISM>  Number of parallel subtasks to run [default: 1]
  -f, --force                      Force the pipeline to start even if the state
                                   file does not match the query
  -h, --help                       Print help
```

By default, `arroyo run` will read a SQL query from STDIN, or the query can be provided
as an argument.

See the [pipeline cluster](/deployment/pipeline-clusters) docs for more details.
