To try out Arroyo, you can run a single node cluster on your machine. This guide will walk you through the process.

## With Docker

The easiest way to get started running Arroyo is with the single-node Docker image. This contains all of the services
you need to get a test Arroyo system up and running.

```bash
$ docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/arroyosystems/arroyo-single:latest
```

<Tip>
    If you get an error like

    ```
    Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:8000:
    bind: address already in use.
    ```

    Then you have another service running on that port. Either stop that service, or rebind to a different port with
    `-p 8002:8000` for example.
</Tip>

This will run all of the core Arroyo services and a temporary Postgres database. The Web UI will be exposed at
http://localhost:8000.

Note that this mode should not be used for production, as it does not persist configuration state and does not support
any distributed runtimes.

## Locally

Arroyo can easily be run locally as well. Currently Linux and MacOS are well supported as development environments.

To run Arroyo locally, follow the steps in the [development guide](/developing/dev-setup).

Now you're ready to create your first pipeline! Continue on to the [tutorial](/tutorial) to learn how.
