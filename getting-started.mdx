To try out Arroyo, you can run a single node cluster on your machine. This guide will walk you through the process.

## With Docker

The easiest way to get started running Arroyo is with the single-node Docker image. This contains all of the services
you need to get a test Arroyo system up and running.

```bash
$ docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8001:8001 ghcr.io/arroyosystems/arroyo-single:multi-arch
```

<Tip>
    If you get an error like

    ```
    Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:8000:
    bind: address already in use.
    ```

    Then you have another service running on that port. Either stop that service, or rebind to a different port with
    `-p 8002:8000` for example.
</Tip>

This will run all of the core arroyo services and a temporary Postgres database. The web UI will be exposed at
http://localhost:8000.

Note that this mode should not be used for production, as it does not persist configuration state and does not support
any distributed runtimes.

## Locally

Arroyo can easily be run locally as well. Currently Linux and MacOS are well supported as development environments.

To run Arroyo locally first follow the dev setup instructions to get a working dev environment. Then, you can start
the API and Controller services:

```bash
$ target/release/arroyo-controller
# in another terminal
$ target/release/arroyo-api
```

Then you can navigate to the web ui at http://localhost:8000.
